## Development

### Prerequisites

This project requires Node for testing, linting, and compilation.

It also needs `yamllint` to lint the yaml files.

```sh
brew install yamllint
```

Finally, this project depends on Yarn, the Node package manager.

```sh
npm install -g yarn
```

### Local Development

To work on the source, install the dependencies, start the local web server, and watch for changes.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:box/developer.box.com.git
cd developer.box.com
yarn install
yarn start
```

This will compile all sources to a `config.json` and serve it on [localhost:8081/config.json](http://localhost:8081/config.json).

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically to the `en` branch using Travis.
