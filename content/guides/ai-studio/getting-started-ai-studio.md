# Get started with AI studio

To start creating custom AI agents with AI studio you need a custom application
with enabled Box AI scope, and a developer token to authenticate your calls.

## Enable Box Doc Gen

To use Box Doc Gen, make sure it is enabled by an
admin in the Admin Console.
If you are a Box Admin, you will find the necessary information in
[Enterprise Settings: Content & Sharing Tab][settings] documentation.

Your Box Admin needs to [enable][enable] the AI studio in the Admin Console.

<!-- This doc should include information on how to enable AI studio and what is needed to start working with the API. Similar doc is already created for Box AI:
- Enable AI Studio for users (admin has to do this)
- See if there are any additional scopes needed
- Create an app and use the developer token to start working -->
