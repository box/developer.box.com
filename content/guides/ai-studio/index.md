# Box AI Studio

<Messsage type='caution'>
Box AI Studio is available only for Enterprise Advance accounts.
</Message>

[Box AI Studio][ai-studio] allows you to build and manage custom AI agents to
best suit your business needs. For example, you can create an AI agent
that acts as a governance consultant, answering questions on your
customer's retention policies. 

## 



## Supported languages

Box AI studio works in a number of languages including
English, Japanese, French, Spanish, and many more.
However, the underlying models are primarily
trained on English language documents. This means
that prompts in other languages may return answers
of lower quality than in English. Tests have shown
satisfactory results for summarizing, checking grammar
and spelling, and answering questions, but bear in mind
that the results may be different than in English.

<Message type="tip">

Switch the language to Japanese to get
better results for this language.
