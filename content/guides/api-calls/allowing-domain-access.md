# Allow domain access

To use the Box APIs it is important that your application and users have access
to the following domains, where needed.

## File preview

To enable file preview, your application might need to load javascript file from
the Box content delivery network (CDN). This file is loaded from the following
domains.

- `api.box.com`
- `boxcdn.net`
- `boxcloud.com`
- `dl2.boxcloud.com` to `dl20.boxcloud.com`

## File downloads

The following API domains are used to download files via the Box API.

- `api.box.com` to initially request a file to download
- `dl.boxcloud.com` to actually download files for authenticated users
- `public.boxcloud.com` to actually download files for unauthenticated users

<Message type='warning'>
  Ensuring access to these domains is only a first step to downloading a file.
  To download a file the users need to have proper access permissions and need
  to be fully authenticated where needed.
