# App Diagnostics Report

The App Diagnostics Report provides a spreadsheet detailing each API call made
by a given application during a specified timeframe. The report gives you
access to the `API Request ID`, which can be given to Box Support for
troubleshooting purposes.

<Message type="warning">
  This report will not include:
    * API calls made within the last 48 hours
    * Authorization and Token API calls
  
  We are working on including the above and thereby making the report suitable
  for real-time troubleshooting in the future.
