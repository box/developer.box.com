# Common Errors

The Box APIs uses [HTTP status codes][status-codes] to communicate if a request
has been successfully processed or not.

## Client error

Most client errors in the HTTP 4XX, and some server errors in the HTTP 5XX range
returns a standard client error JSON object.

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "status": 400,
  "code": "bad_digest",
  "help_url": "http://developers.box.com/docs/#errors",
  "message": "The specified Content-MD5 did not match what we received",
  "request_id": "abcdef123456"
}
```

Please see the [Client Error resource](resource://client_error) for more details.

## Common error codes

Please check our [Developer Troubleshooting Articles][articles]
for solution to common errors encountered when working with the Box APIs.

| **Solution** | While uploading a file, a `Content-MD5` header with the SHA-1 hash of the file can be supplied to ensure that the file is not corrupted in transit. The SHA-1 hash that was supplied in the request did not match what was received in the upload. Supply a valid SHA-1 hash of the uploaded file.                                                                        |

| **Solution** | The folder ID specified in the folder move would create a cyclical folder structure (for example moving a folder to a subfolder within itself).

| **Message**  | Verify the authorization code is set correctly in your request, or your application likely needs to get a new authorization code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Solution** | The authorization code supplied in the API request is missing or no longer valid. Possible solutions are to verify that the access token is added correctly in the request. If correctly set, the access token may have expired. Attempt to refresh the access token or fetch a new one.                                                                                  |

| **Solution** | The admin of your Box account has set custom terms of service and the user has not logged in to accept the terms yet. The user will need to accept the terms of service, or the admin will have to disable them, in order to proceed.

Content that is simply moved to the trash will still count towards the account total until it is permanently deleted. |

| **Message**  | The item name is reserved by another processing item. Wait and then retry the request, or wait and check the parent folder to see if the name is in use.                                                                                                     |

| **Solution** | The upload session is in an unrecoverable failed state and cannot continue. This or other requests have resulted in the upload session reaching a bad state (for example parts overlapping). Possible situations where this may arise include when the maximum number of parts has been exceeded or when overlapping parts have been uploaded. |

| **Solution** | The client is performing operations too quickly and has been rate limited. Client is advised to retry their request after the amount of time specified by the Retry-After header. There are four rate limits to be aware of. There is a limit of 10 API calls per second per user. There is also a limit of 4 uploads per second per user, 6 searches per second per user up to 60 searches per minute, and 12 searches per second per enterprise. To solve this error, consider either backing off when rate limits are hit using an [exponential back off method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff), caching information when possible to reduce necessary calls, or imposing throttling on calls made from the application to Box. |
