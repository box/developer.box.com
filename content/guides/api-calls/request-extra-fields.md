# Request Extra Fields

The number of fields returned for a resource can depend on the API endpoint used
to request the resource.

| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Standard | The standard set of fields returned when requesting a resource for its own endpoints, for example when requesting a file through the [`GET /files/:id`](endpoint://get_files_id) endpoint                                                                        |
| Full     | The full set of fields that can be returned through a resource's own endpoints by using the `field` query parameter                                                                                                                                              |
| Mini     | A subset of fields that is returned when a resource is returned as a nested part of another resource, for example when a file is returned when requesting all items in a folder through the [`GET /folders/:id/items`](endpoint://get_folders_id_items) endpoint |

The API reference documentation has each of these variations labeled in more
detail. Most notably, the file, folder, web link, and user items have full and
mini variations.

## Using the field query parameter

To request a specific field for a resource that is not returned by default in
the standard response, append the `field` query parameter to your request. The
value of this parameter is a comma separated list of field names.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/12345?fields=is_package,lock \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "etag": "1",
  "id": "12345",
  "is_package": false,
  "lock": null,
  "type": "file"
}
```

<Message type="notice">
  It is important to note that when a specific field is requested no other
  fields are returned except for those requested and the "base" set of fields.
  For a file, this base set is comprised of the `etag`, `id`, and `type` values.
</Message>

## Resource

The following resource variants are available via our API.

### Standard

The default set of fields returned in an API response is commonly known as the
standard resource variant. It is generally returned when requesting a resource
through the main APIs available for that resource. For example, when requesting
the [`GET /files/:id`](endpoint://get_files_id) endpoint the API will return
the standard variation of a file.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/12345 \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
    "content_created_at": "2019-06-20T06:04:41-07:00",
    "content_modified_at": "2019-06-20T06:04:41-07:00",
    "created_at": "2019-06-20T07:28:42-07:00",
    "created_by": {
        "id": "191919191",
        "login": "joe@example.com",
        "name": "Joe Box",
        "type": "user"
    },
    "description": "",
    "etag": "1",
    "file_version": {
        "id": "56663434454334",
        "sha1": "585afa5209bbd586c79499b7336601341ad06cce",
        "type": "file_version"
    },
    "id": "12345",
    ...
    "size": 65000647,
    "trashed_at": null,
    "type": "file"
}
```

### Mini

Where a resource is returned as a nested part of another response it is often
reduced in size, only returning some of the more essential fields. This variant
is commonly known as the mini resource variant.

For example, when requesting the
[`GET /folders/:id/items`](endpoint://get_folders_id_items) endpoint the API
will return a mini variation of files and folders nested within the `item_collection`.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/12345 \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "type": "folder",
  "item_collection": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "etag": "1",
        "file_version": {
          "id": "56663434454334",
          "sha1": "585afa5209bbd586c79499b7336601341ad06cce",
          "type": "file_version"
        },
        "id": "12345",
        "name": "Video.mp4",
        "sequence_id": "1",
        "sha1": "585afa5209bbd586c79499b7336601341ad06cce",
        "type": "file"
      }
      ...
    ]
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```

<Message type='notice'>
  To request more information for a nested resource we recommend calling the
  API for that resource to request it by ID, and optionally pass along the
  `field` query parameter.

  For example, to get the owner of a file returned when listing the items in a
  folder, request that file by ID with the query parameter `field=owned_by`.
</Message>

### Full

The total set of fields that can be returned in an API response is commonly known
as the full resource variant. It can generally be returned when requesting a resource
through the main APIs available for that resource and by appending the `fields`
query parameter.

For example, when requesting the [`GET /files/:id`](endpoint://get_files_id)
endpoint with the `fields=is_package,lock` parameter the API will return the fields
specified plus the basic fields for the file.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/12345?fields=is_package,lock \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

```json
{
  "etag": "1",
  "id": "12345",
  "is_package": false,
  "lock": null,
  "type": "file"
}
```
