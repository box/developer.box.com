# Suppress Notifications

For some API calls, email and webhook notifications can be prevented by
including a `Box-Notifications: off` header with the API call.

  <Tab title='cURL'>

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.box.com/2.0/folders \
  -H "Box-Notifications: off" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
      "name": "New Folder",
      "parent": {
        "id": "0"
      }
    }'
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

As an example, this can be used for a virus-scanning tool to download copies
every user's files in an enterprise without every collaborator on the file
receiving an email informing them of the download.

All actions will still appear in users updates feed and the audit-logs.
