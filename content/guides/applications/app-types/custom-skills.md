# Custom Skill

A Custom Skill, or Box Skill is a type of application that performs custom
processing for files uploaded to Box. Skills are designed to make it
straightforward to use third-party Machine Learning services to automatically
extract information from files uploaded to Box and apply the resulting data as
metadata on the file.

Custom Skills need to be enabled on a folder by a Box Admin. After this an event
is sent to the Skill's application server every time a file is uploaded to the
folder. This application can then download the file, inspect it or hand it off
to a machine learning service, and write powerful metadata to the file.

## Authentication methods

Working with Custom Skills is simplified by the pre-authorized API credentials
that are provided with every Skill Event. For this reason though, Custom Skills
have limited API access. You do not need to select an authentication type to
work with this type of application.

## When to use

A Custom Skill is best used when the application:

- Wants to only add metadata to files uploaded to Box
- Does not want to upload new files or perform any other API calls
- Wants to have way to pass files to Machine Learning services without having to handle authentication

## Use cases

Example use cases for Custom Skills include:

- A process that automatically extracts license plate details from images and writes the details back to the file as keywords.

- A process that automatically detects faces in videos, and writes the timestamps at which these faces occur back to the file as a timeline.

## Approval

Before a Custom Skill can be used it needs to be assigned
to a folder for which the skill should trigger.
