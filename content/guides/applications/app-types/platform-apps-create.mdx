A Platform App allows for interaction with our 150+ endpoints.
For example, downloading/uploading, searching, applying metadata and more.

## Prerequisites

Access to the [Developer Console][dev-console].

## Create a Platform App

1. Navigate to the [Developer Console][dev-console].
2. Select **Create Platform App**.
3. Provide a name for your app.
4. Select the authentication method you want to use.
5. Click **Create App**.

## Configure application settings

After you create a Platform App, the settings screen is displayed.

### General settings

- **App Name** - the name you set up during the app creation, you can change it here if needed.
- **App Description** - provide a description for your app (optional).
- **Contact Email** - this is set to the developer of the application by default. 
Keep in mind that once you publish your app, this email is publicly visible to Box users
who view your app in the [Integrations][integrations]. We recommend to change it to a
support email address, so that users can reach out to support in case of any issues with
the integration.
