# Custom Apps

By far the more flexible way to use Box Platform is through a **Custom App**
integration.

Custom Apps support [OAuth 2.0][oauth2], [JWT][jwt], and [App Token][app-token]
authentication. They allow the application to manipulate files and folders, as
well as interact with tasks, legal holds, and other enterprise-level properties.

A custom application typically presents Box functionality to a user within a
custom interface. Box offers pre-built user interface components known as UI
Elements for functionality like browsing, search, viewing and more that can be
customized, or you can build your own.

## Authentication methods

Custom Apps support three different types of authentication that determine the
abilities and restrictions of your application. The following is a quick
overview of the key differences.

## When to use a Custom App

A Custom App is best used when the application:

- Wants to use [OAuth 2.0][oauth2], [JWT][jwt], or [App Token][app-token] authentication
- Wants to upload and download files
- Wants the freedom to access both their own files, as well as files owned by
  other users, even external users.
- Wants the option to list the application in the Box App Gallery
- Wants to provide integration into the Box Web App
