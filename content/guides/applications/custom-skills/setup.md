## Approval

Before a Custom Skill can be used it needs to be assigned to a folder for which the
skill should trigger.

## Basic configuration

Before a Custom Skill can be enabled enabled on a folder, some basic additional
configuration needs to be set up.

### Invocation URL

Custom Skills work by sending a payload for every file uploaded a remote URL.
This URL is called the invocation URL.

The Invocation URL can be any HTTP endpoint representing a server, development
machine, or serverless function. The only condition is that the URL is publicly
available and accessible by the Box servers. For this reason, `localhost` is not
a valid address.

To set up the Invocation URL, head over to the [Developer Console][devconsole],
select your application, and select on the "Configuration" panel on the left
hand side.

Scroll down to the "Invocation URL" section.

</ImageFrame>

Fill in a secure HTTPs address and save the form. The invocation URL has now
been configured.

### File Extensions

By default a Custom Skill will trigger for any file type in the folder. To
specify specific file extensions to trigger the Skill for, scroll down to the
"File Extensions" section of the "Configuration" panel of your application.
