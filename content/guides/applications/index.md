# Applications

Box Developer Console allows you to create applications
you can then use to integrate with Box.
**My Apps** view displays a list of already created applications
and gives you quick access to their configuration details.
This way, you don't need to open
the app each time you want to generate
a Developer Token, copy the Client ID, or generate a report.
