# Applications

Box Developer Console allows you to create applications
you can then use to integrate with Box.
My Apps view displays a list of already created applications
and gives you quick access to their configuration details
and additional options. This way, you don't need to open
the app each time you want to generate
a Developer Token or copy the Client ID.

## Features

The My Apps page allows you to:

1. Create [a new app][select].
2. View application description using the `i` icon.
3. Copy the Client ID using the `copy` icon.
4. Check application [enablement][enablement] and [authorization][authorization] status. Apps published to App Center display status from App Center.
5. Use a menu available for every entry to access the configuration details of your application or to generate a [Developer Token][token].
