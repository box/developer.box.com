# Integrations

The [Box Integrations][app-center] is the first place for Box users to find out
about applications that they can use in combination with Box. If your
application is suited to be used by other enterprises, listing your service in
the Integrations can be a great way to find new users.
Integrations groups apps into sections so that you can
quickly find featured, most popular, or recently added apps.
