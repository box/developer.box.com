# Web App Integration

Web App Integrations allow third-party applications to
become part of the Box user experience by 
allowing users to use such third-party applications
when editing or sharing files.

## Features

- **File interaction**. Users can modify, share, or edit content stored in Box using a third-party application. 
- **Recommended Apps support**. Integrations can appear in the Box Preview interface under **Recommended Apps**. For details, see [Recommended Web Integrations][recommended-web-integrations].

- **Scoped availability**. Integrations can be restricted to certain content types and file extensions.

## Visibility in Recommended Apps

Your web application integration appears in **Recommended Apps** only if it's not published in App Center.
