# Web App Integration

Web App Integrations allow third-party applications to
become part of the Box user experience by 
allowing users to use such third-party applications
when editing or sharing files.

## Features

Using a Web App Integration, a user can modify, share, or edit content stored in
Box using a third-party application. It can also offer new features to Box users
through [Recommended Apps][recommended-apps], which show up in Box Preview.

By enabling a Web App Integration, an application can be added to Recommended
Apps, allowing users to use their files in the application. Integrations can be
restricted to certain content types and file extensions.
