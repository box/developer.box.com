# Authentication

Authentication with the Box API uses an Access Token to identify a user. The
way in which an Access Token is acquired depends on the method used to authorize
a user. The type of authorization available to an application depends on the
use-case as well as the type of application that has been created in the developer
console.

## Access Tokens for Authentication

Every API endpoint requires a valid and active **Access Token** to make API
calls. An Access Token is a unique string that identifies an authenticated Box
user to the API endpoints.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer EGmDmRVfhfHsqesn5yVYHAqUkD0dyDfk"
```

## User Authorization

There are a few ways to get an an Access Token for a user. There is
client-side authorization through [OAuth 2.0][oauth2], server-side authorization
using [JWT][jwt], as well as a long lived [App Token][apptoken] and a
short-lived [Developer Token][devtoken].
