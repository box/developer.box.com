# As-User Header

It is possible to for an OAuth 2.0 application to act on behalf of another user
through the `As-User` header.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/folders/0 \
  -H "As-User: [USER_ID]"
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]"
```

<Message>
In this situation the user ID is the Box identifier for a user. User IDs can
found for any user via the `GET /users` endpoint, which is only available to
admins, or by calling the `GET /users/me` endpoint with an authenticated user session.
</Message>

## Preconditions

Using the `As-User` header has a few requirements. Firstly, the application
needs to be configured to perform actions as users in the [developer
console][devconsole].

Additionally, the authenticated user needs to be a user with admin permissions,
meaning either an admin, co-admin, or service account. See our guide on [User
Types](g://authentication/user-types) for more details.

<Message warning>
  Please note that some of our SDKs create new clients for the other user, while
  others modify the existing client and provide a way to return to a state where
  the client authenticates for the original user itself.
