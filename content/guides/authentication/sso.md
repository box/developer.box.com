# Box API & SSO

Many Box Enterprises use **Single Sign On** (SSO) to authenticate
[Managed Users][user-types] logging in to Box. The way applications built on
Box Platform interact with the SSO provider depends on the type of application
being built.

## Custom Apps with Client-side Authentication

When using an application configured as a [Custom App][custom_app] that uses
client-side [OAuth 2.0] to authenticate users, the Box API will automatically
redirect a user's browser to the configured SSO log-in screen.

If the enterprise is configured to require SSO, rather than just enabled, then
every user that wants to log in  must have a SSO user profile associated their
Box account.

<Message warning>
  It is not possible to exempt a user from any SSO requirements if it is only
  used for platform use cases. In these scenarios we recommend using server-side
  authentication.
</Message>

## Custom Apps with Server-side Authentication

In any other situation a Custom App is authenticated using server-side
technology and no actual Managed User is involved. For this reason, SSO is not
involved in this process. These applications often

This means that for [Custom Apps][custom_app] that use [JWT][jwt] or [App
Token][app_token] authentication no SSO log-in is involved.

Instead, these applications authenticate as a [Service Account][user-types] that
does not have access to any Managed User's data. For these applications to have
access to other user's data they will need explicit [admin approval][admin-approval].

## Custom Skills

[Custom Skills][custom_skills] are authenticated in a unique way where the
application is provided with a unique set of access tokens for every skill
event.

In this case, the application does not directly interact with the users and
therefore SSO is not involved.

<Message>
  Even when using Skills, a user uploading a file to a folder that might trigger
  a Skill event would still need to log in to the web or mobile app. This log in
  would require them to use SSO where needed.
