# Limited Access App Approval

Limited Access Apps are automatically authorized for use in an enterprise upon
creation. 

However, if the enterprise setting to
**Require manual admin authorization for transactional access apps** is enabled,
an Admin must preform additional steps. 

## Approval Notifications

A semi-automated process to submit an app approval is available in the Developer
Console.

Navigate to the **Authorization** tab for your application in the
[Developer Console][devconsole].

Submitting the application for approval will send an email to your
enterprise's Primary Admin to approve the application. More information on this
process is available in our [support article on app authorization][app-auth].

## Manual Approval

The following steps provide instructions on how to manually approve the
application.

### As a developer

As the developer, navigate to the **Configuration** tab for your application
in the [Developer Console][devconsole]. Scroll down to the OAuth 2.0 Credentials
section and copy the Client ID value to provide to a Box Admin.

  # Finding a Box Admin

  If you don't know your enterprise Admin, go to your Box [Account
  Settings][settings] page and scroll to the bottom. If an admin contact is set
  you should see their contact  information under "Admin Contact".
</Message>

### As an Admin

As a Box Admin, navigate to the [Admin Console][adminconsole] and
select the **Apps** tab (1) from the left navigation panel. Then, click the
**Custom Apps** tab (2) at the top of your screen. On this screen, you will
see a **+** button in the top right corner to add a new app authorization.

In the popup that appears, enter the Client ID for the application that the
developer collected from the **Configuration** tab of the Developer Console.

## Re-authorization on changes

When the application's scopes or access level change the application needs to be
re-authorized. Repeat the process above and request a new Access Token for the
new changes to take effect.

In the same section where the application was initially authorized, an Admin
can re-authorize the application by clicking on the ellipses to the right
of the application name to **Reauthorize App**.
