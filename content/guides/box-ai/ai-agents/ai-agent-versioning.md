# AI agent configuration versioning

<Message type='notice'>
Box updates the default models across the endpoints on a regular basis in order to stay up to date with the most advanced options. If a default model is updated, it will be posted in the developer changelog.

</Message>

AI agent configuration versioning gives the developers more control over AI agent versioning and ensures consistent responses.

AI agent configuration versioning adopts the following principles:

* Each AI agent snapshot is supported for at least 12 months, unless there are factors outside of Box's control. For example, a Large Language Model (LLM) may get deprecated.
* An AI agent snapshot is available unless a new, stable agent version is released
* A 6-month window is provided to test and transition to the new snapshot.

## Historical AI agent configuration

The values in the [default agent configuration][default-config] used by the LLM gateway often change to achieve the best possible answer quality. 

To make sure your configurations are not affected in a negative way, you can use the historical AI agent configuration provided below to [override the default one][overrides].

It should also avoid making assumptions or inferences not supported by the provided document snippets.\n\nGuidelines: When answering, the assistant should consider the file's name and path to assess relevance to the question. In cases of conflicting information from multiple documents, it should list the different answers with citations. For summarization or comparison tasks, it should concisely answer with the key points. It should also consider the current date to be the date given.\n\nPersonalization: The assistant's tone should be formal and to-the-point, suitable for handling business-related documents and queries.\n",
