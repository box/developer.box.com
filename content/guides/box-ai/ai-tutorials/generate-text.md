# Generate text with Box AI

<Message type="notice">
Box AI API is available to all customers Business and above.

</Message>

You can use Box AI to generate text
based on provided content.
 For example, you can ask Box AI to
 generate a template based
 on the content you read or create in Box Notes.
 Then you can embed the generated text
 directly into your document.
 
## Before you start

Make sure you followed the steps listed in [getting started with Box AI][prereq] to create a platform app and authenticate.

## Send a request

To send a request, use the
`POST /2.0/ai/text_gen` endpoint.

<Samples id='post_ai_text_gen' />

### Parameters

To make a call, you must pass the following parameters. Mandatory parameters are in **bold**.

**Note**: The `items` array can have exactly one element.

| Parameter| Description| Example|
|--------|--------|-------|
|**`prompt`**| The request for Box AI to generate or refine the text. The prompt's length cannot exceed 10000 characters.|Create a meeting agenda for a weekly sales meeting.|
|**`items.id`**|Box file ID of the document. |`1233039227512`|
|**`items.type`**|The type of the supplied input. | `file`|
| `items.content` | The content of the item, often the text representation.  |    `This article is about Box AI`.    |
| `dialogue_history.prompt` | The prompt previously provided by the client and answered by the Large Language Model (LLM).  | `Make my email about public APIs sound more professional` |
| `dialogue_history.answer` | The answer previously provided by the LLM. |   `Here is a draft of your professional email about public APIs.` |
| `dialogue_history.created_at` | The ISO date formatted timestamp of when the previous answer to the prompt was created.   | `2012-12-12T10:53:43-08:00` |
|`ai_agent` | The AI agent used to override the default agent configuration. This parameter allows you to, for example, replace the default LLM with a custom one using the [`model`][model-param] parameter, tweak the base [`prompt`][prompt-param] to allow for a more customized user experience, or change an LLM parameter, such as `temperature`, to make the results more or less creative. Before you use the `ai_agent` parameter, you can get the default configuration using the [`GET 2.0/ai_agent_default`][agent] request. For specific use cases, see the [AI model overrides tutorial][overrides]| | 

## Use cases

Generate text based on the provided file content and a prompt.

```sh
curl -i -L POST "https://api.box.com/2.0/ai/text_gen" \
     -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -H "authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" \
     -d '{
    "items": [
        {
            "id": "12345678",
            "type": "file"
        }
    ],
    "prompt": "Create a short blog post that provides information on Box AI for Documents and focuses on best practices for asking questions. You can add emoticons, but not too many."
