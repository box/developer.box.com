# Extract metadata from file (freeform)

<Message type="notice">
Box AI Platform API is currently a beta feature offered subject to Boxâ€™s Main Beta Agreement, and the available capabilities may change. Box AI Platform API is available to all Enterprise Plus customers.

</Message>

Box AI Platform API allows you to extract metadata in a freeform way
from the provided file and return it in the form of key-value pairs.
To use this endpoint, you don't need any metadata templates,
as providing the prompt and the input file is enough to get the answer.

## Send a request

To send a request, use the
`POST /2.0/ai/extract` endpoint.

Make sure you have generated the developer token
to authorize your app. See [prerequisites for using Box AI][prereq]
for details.

|**`items.type`**|The type of the supplied input. | `file`|
| `items.content` | The content of the item, often the text representation.  |    `This article is about Box AI`.    |
| `dialogue_history.prompt` | The prompt previously provided by the client and answered by the Large Language Model (LLM).  | `Make my email about public APIs sound more professional` |
| `dialogue_history.answer` | The answer previously provided by the LLM. |   `Here is a draft of your professional email about public APIs.` |

|`ai_agent` | The AI agent used to override the default agent configuration. This parameter allows you to, for example, replace the default LLM with a custom one using the [`model`][model-param] parameter, tweak the base [`prompt`][prompt-param] to allow for a more customized user experience, or change an LLM parameter, such as `temperature`, to make the results more or less creative. Before using the `ai_agent` parameter, you can get the default configuration using the [`GET 2.0/ai_agent_default`][agent] request.| |
