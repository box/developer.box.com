# Box MCP Server

The Box MCP Server allows third-party AI systems to securely connect and interact with your content in Box. With a dedicated URL, Box allows external platforms that have also adopted MCP to plug in and work automatically with Box content.

Box MCP Server is in beta, and features will be gradually added to extend it's capabilities.
