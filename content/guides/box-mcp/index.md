# Box MCP Server

Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs.

Think of MCP as systems plugin for apps like Cursor, Claude for Desktop, or Copilot. It allows you to extend the Agentâ€™s capabilities by connecting it to various data sources and tools through standardized interfaces.

The Box MCP Server allows MCP client to securely connect and perform actions related to content stored in Box. 

There are two ways you can interact with Box MCP Server. Check detailed guides on both Box MCP Servers, as the implemented methods in both servers differ.
