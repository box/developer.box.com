# Box MCP Server

Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP servers make building advanced integrations simpler and less time consuming.

Box MCP Server allows third party AI agents from platforms like Copilot Studio, Cursor, Claude for Desktop to access Box content seamlessly. It extends the agentâ€™s capabilities by allowing it to perform actions related to content stored in Box.

There are two Box MCP Servers:

- Remote Box MCP Server which you can enable in the Box Admin Console. It is hosted directly in Box.
<!--alex ignore-->
- Self-hosted Box MCP Server which you can clone and host on your local machine, as this version in an open source Box Developer community project.
<!--alex enable-->

Check the detailed guides on both Box MCP Servers, as the level of the implemented tools differs. Learn how to enable Box MCP Server:
