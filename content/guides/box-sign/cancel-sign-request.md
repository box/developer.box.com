# Cancel Box Sign Request

A Box Sign request, that has not yet been signed or declined, can be cancelled
using the [cancel Box Sign request endpoint][cancel]. Any outstanding signers
will no longer be able to sign the document.

Only the user who created the request, the requester, is able to cancel it. A
request cannot be cancelled if it was declined, fully signed, or the document
is still converting.
