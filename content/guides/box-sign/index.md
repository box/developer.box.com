# Box Sign

Programmatically harness the full functionality of the Box Sign web app
experience by leveraging Box Signâ€™s API endpoints to create, list, resend, and
cancel sign requests.

## Enablement

<Message type='warning'>
Box Sign is now available on all business (Business , Business Plus) and
enterprise (Enterprise, Enterprise Plus, Enterprise Suites) plans. Box will
notify customers before Box Sign becomes available on Starter plans.
</Message>

If your account type supports access to Box Sign, you will be able to make
requests via the Box Sign API. Supported tariffs include: Business, Business
Plus, Enterprise, Enterprise Suites, Enterprise Plus, or Starter. To locate your
account type, navigate to **Account Settings** and scroll down to the
**Account Details** section of the **Account** tab. For Admin details on
restricting access, please see our [support article][restrict].  

## Required Scopes

The following [scopes][scopes] must be enabled for an application before use of
Box Sign's endpoints.

- [Read all files and folders stored in Box][read]
- [Write all files and folders stored in Box][write]
- [Manage signature requests][sign]

<Message type='warning'>
  Depending on the selected authentication method and enterprise's settings,
  your application may require Admin authorization or re-authorization before
  successful use of any newly selected scopes.

## Testing

Due to the feature parity, it may be useful to familiarize yourself with
[Box Sign functionality using the Box web app][webapp] before leveraging the
API. As with all API endpoints, we recommend testing via 
[developer sandbox environment][sandbox] to eliminate the risk of impacting
production content.
