# Box Sign

Programmatically harness the full functionality of the Box Sign web app
experience by leveraging Box Signâ€™s API endpoints to create, list, resend, and
cancel sign requests.

## Enablement

<Message type='warning'>
 On July 26th, 2021, Box began rolling out Box Sign to select customers.
 On Oct. 7, Box Sign was made available to all US and Canadian customers
 on Business plans and above. Overall, we plan to make Box Sign
 available to customers on business (Business, Business Plus), enterprise
 (Enterprise, Enterprise Plus, Enterprise Suites), and Starter plans.
 While Box Sign does not need to be enabled by an Admin to use its API
 endpoints, it does need to be rolled out to your enterprise. Box will
 continue to notify admins before Box Sign becomes available in their Box
 instance.
</Message>

If your account type supports access to Box Sign, you will be able to make
requests via the Box Sign API. Supported tariffs include: Business, Business
Plus, Enterprise, Enterprise Suites, Enterprise Plus, or Starter. To locate your
account type, navigate to **Account Settings** and scroll down to the
**Account Details** section of the **Account** tab. For Admin details on
restricting access, please see our [support article][restrict].  

## Required Scopes

The following [scopes][scopes] must be enabled for an application before use of
Box Sign's endpoints.

- [Read all files and folders stored in Box][read]
- [Write all files and folders stored in Box][write]
- [Manage signature requests][sign]

<Message type='warning'>
  Depending on the selected authentication method and enterprise's settings,
  your application may require Admin authorization or re-authorization before
  successful use of any newly selected scopes.

## Rate Limits

Please see our [rate limit guide][ratelimit] for more information.

## Testing

Due to the feature parity, it may be useful to familiarize yourself with
[Box Sign functionality using the Box web app][webapp] before leveraging the
API. As with all API endpoints, we recommend testing via 
[developer sandbox environment][sandbox] to eliminate the risk of impacting
production content.
