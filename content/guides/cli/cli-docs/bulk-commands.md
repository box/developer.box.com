# CLI bulk commands

The Box CLI bulk commands help you to automate repetitive tasks. By adding a `--bulk-file-path` flag to your command, you are able to perform actions for many items at once.

For example, this command creates several folders using a CSV file specifying folder `Name`, `Description`, and the `ParentId` of the parent folder: 

```bash
box folders:create --bulk-file-path <PATH_TO_CSV>/folders-create.csv
```

## CSV templates

Predefined CSV templates help you to structure the data you want to manage in bulk. Templates reside in the [`Bulk actions`][bulkactions] directory, grouped into folders. The table below lists the currently available templates.

| Templates      | Description   | 
|----------------|---------------|  
| box collaborations| Create, delete, and update collaborations. | 
| box files| Download, update, and upload files.| 
| box folders| Create and update folders, add metadata to folders. | 
| box groups| Create groups and add memberships. | 
| box metadata-templates| Create metadata templates and metadata cascade policies on folders. | 
| box shared-links| Delete shared links.| 
| box users| Create and update users, move one user's content to another user. | 
| box webhooks| Delete webhooks. | 

## Prerequisites

To use bulk commands, you will need a Box application
with OAuth 2.0 authentication. If you don't have one,
go to your [Developer Console][console], and follow the guide 
[Setup with OAuth 2.0][auth].

## Set up and use bulk commands

1. Clone the `boxcli` GitHub repository 
   or download the files from [`Bulk actions`][bulkactions] directory.

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git
   ```

2. Adjust the `.csv` template to your needs. For example, if you want to create several folders, you can use the [`folders-create.csv`][folderstemplate] template as your starting point.
3. Run the command.

   ```bash
   box users:create --bulk-file-path <PATH_TO_CSV>/folders-create.csv
   ```
