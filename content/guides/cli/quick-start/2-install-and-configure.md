# CLI Installation and Configuration

<Choice option='cli.app_type' value='create_new,use_existing,clicked' color='none'>
Installers are available for Windows and macOS. However, the raw source-code is
available if you would like to build the CLI in other environments.

## Windows & macOS Installers

To install the latest CLI on your machine, download the latest
`.exe` for Windows or `.pkg` for macOS for the latest release.

## Linux & Node install

Additionally, the CLI can be installed as a Node package on any platform,
including Linux. For this to work you will need to have
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.

```bash
npm install --global @box/cli
```

## Source Code

The source code for the CLI is available via [GitHub][cli].

## Run configuration command

You will now need to configure the CLI by logging in to your Box App.

In this step, we will use the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from the
previous step to log you in and create an **Access Token** for your user.

## The reason to log in

Currently you have provided us with the following information.

<Store disabled inline id='cli_credentials.client_id'>
  Client ID
</Store>

<Store disabled inline obscured id='cli_credentials.client_secret'>
  Client Secret
</Store>

<!--alex ignore execute-->
Open your terminal or command line and execute the command: `box login -n example_name`.

Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into the terminal window when prompted.

CLI by entering the command `box users:get me`.
