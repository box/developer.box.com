# Using PowerShell Scripts with the Box CLI

By itself, the CLI is already powerful, but using it alongside a PowerShell
script lets you complete repetitive tasks even quicker. We created an example
[scripts][scripts] folder within our CLI GitHub repository to help
jump start your development.

To show you how CLI scripts work, we are going to use the
provision and create users [script][script-1]
template.

This script uses the Box CLI to build and create an
onboarding folder structure, create managed users in bulk,
and provision such new users by adding them to the newly created
folder structure as collaborators with viewer or uploader roles.

<Message type=warning>
   This part of the quick start for service accounts 
   and users with administrative privileges only. 
   Skip this step if you are not a Box administrator
   or you do not use a service account.
</Message>

## Use case

To automatically create users and folder structure, the script
performs the following steps:

1. Uses a `.csv` file to load employee data in bulk.
2. Defines folder structure using a JSON file or uploads
   the structure from the user's local directory.
3. Creates a managed user a predetermined folder structure to each user.

## Prerequisites

### Windows

Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### MacOS & Linux

Install [PowerShell][pwsh]

<message>
If you encounter issues make sure you installed both 
[dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and 
[PowerShell][pwsh]
</message>

### Configured Box application

You should have a Box application created.
If you haven't done so yet, see [step 1][step 1] of this quick start guide.
Alternatively, go to your [developer console][console], and follow the guide
[Setup with OAuth 2.0][auth].

## Download the script

Clone the script to a directory of your choice
and navigate to that directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git box-cli
cd box-cli/examples/User\ Creation\ \&\ Provisioning/
```

## Configure the script settings

Adapt the script to run in your own environment.
In this example, you will use the sample data provided
with the script.

### Provide the parameters

There are a few parameters you need to supply before running the script:

- `EmployeeList`: Path to `Employee List` CSV.
- `RootFolderParentID`: Destination folder ID for your changes,
either when using a JSON file as input to create folder structure,
or uploading a local structure. It is set to `0` by default,
but feel free to change it.
- `FolderStructureJSONPath`: Your own folder structure JSON path.
You can also change the `RootFolderName`.
It's the name of the folder that will be created as the parent for folders
defined in the JSON structure.
It's set to `Onboarding` by default, but feel free to change it.
- `LocalUploadPath`: Local directory to upload folder structure directly.

<Message>
Specify either a local upload path or a JSON file with the folder
structure, not both.
</Message>

### Update the user list

You can use the following sample files to load users:
`Employees_1.csv`, `Employees_5.csv`, and `Employees_10.csv`.
Each will load 1, 5 or 10 new users.

Customize these files for a test run. For example, update the
`Employees_1.csv` with the following data:

```bash
firstName,lastName,email
Isaac,Newton,abc@abc.local
```

With the `EmployeeList` parameter, specify which `.csv` file you would like
to load data from.

### Create folder structure

You can either create a folder structure from a JSON
file or upload it from your local drive.

#### Use a JSON file

The `Folder_Structure.json` file contains the folder structure you want to create.
As an example you will create a `Market Research` and a `Sales Plays`
folder, each with a subfolder `Statistics` and `Big Pharma` respectively.
The script will place this folder structure
under the `Onboarding` folder.

With the `FolderStructureJSONPath` parameter, provide the location of the
`Folder_Structure.json` file.

#### Upload file from local drive

You can also upload a folder structure directly
from the local file system. With the `LocalUploadPath` parameter, provide the
path to your local folder you want to upload.

### Update the parameters

You have 3 ways to pass parameters before running the script:

- Use static values in the script

<Message>
  Remember to update all required parameters in the script before running.
</Message>

  ```bash
  # Set Employee List CSV Path
  $EmployeeList = ""

  # Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly
  # upload a local folder
  $FolderStructureJSONPath = ""
  $LocalUploadPath = ""

  # Name of folder that will be created as parent root folder for folders
  # defined in json file
  $RootFolderName = "Onboarding"

  # ID of folder, wherein root folder will be created if using JSON structure,
  # otherwise it's a destination folder for local uploaded folder structure.
  $RootFolderParentID = ""
  ```

- Run the script with parameters

  You can specify parameters while running the script, for example:

  ```bash
  PS > ./Users_Create_Provision.ps1 -EmployeeList ./Employees_1.csv `
      -LocalUploadPath ./OnboardingLocalUpload `
      -RootFolderName Onboarding `
      -RootFolderParentID 0

  Starting User Creation & Provisioning script...
  ```

- Provide the parameters when prompted

  If some parameters are still missing at runtime,
  the script will prompt you to provide them:

  ```bash
  PS > ./Users_Create_Provision.ps1
  Please enter the path to the employee list CSV file:
  ./Employees_1.csv
  Please enter the path to the folder structure JSON file or the local upload path:
  Folder_Structure.json
  Folder structure JSON path set to: Folder_Structure.json
  Please enter the ID of the parent folder for the root folder:
  0
  Starting User Creation & Provisioning script...
  ```

## Run the script

1. Change the directory to the folder containing the script.
   In this example, it is the `User Creation & Provisioning`
   folder.

   ```bash
   rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning$ pwsh
   PowerShell 7.2.4
   Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

   https://aka.ms/powershell
   Type 'help' to get help.

   /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning>
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning> ./Users_Create_Provision.ps1
   ```

   The response will be similar to the following:

   ```bash
   Starting User Creation & Provisioning script...
