# Provision users and folders

This script uses the Box CLI to build and create a
personal folder structure, create managed users in bulk, 
and provision such new users by adding them to the newly created 
folder structure as collaborators with viewer or uploader role.

For details, see the quick start guide on 
[using Box CLI and sample scripts][1].
