# Report inactive users

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

This script generates a CSV file with a list of users who have been inactive for a number of days. It performs the following steps:

1. Looks for the users who have the role `user`. 

   <message>
   The script does not consider other roles, such as `AppUser`.
   </message>
   
2. Uses [Box Events][boxevents] to check if the user performed any actions   
   for a specified number of days.
   The default list of event types includes: `LOGIN`,`UPLOAD`,`COPY`,`MOVE`,`PREVIEW`,`DOWNLOAD`,`EDIT`,`DELETE`,`UNDELETE`,`LOCK`,`UNLOCK`, `NEW_USER`. You can modify this list in the script settings.
3. Adds users who didn't perform any actions to a `.csv` file with
   inactive users. You can use this file as input for other scripts, for example to [deprovision users][deprovisionscript].

## Prerequisites

### Windows

Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### MacOS & Linux

Install [PowerShell][pwsh]. Run the `pwsh` command to test the installation.

   ```bash
    pwsh 
   ```

Depending on the directory you are
running the command in, the output may differ.
For example:

   ```bash
   PowerShell 7.2.5
   Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

   https://aka.ms/powershell
   Type 'help' to get help.
     
   PS /Users/user/repos/boxcli/examples> 
   ```

   <message>
      If you encounter issues make sure you installed both 
      [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and 
      [PowerShell][pwsh].
   </message>

### Box application

To use the script, you will need a Box application
with OAuth 2.0 authentication. If you don't have one,
go to your [Developer Console][console], and follow the guide 
[Setup with OAuth 2.0][auth].

## Configure the script

1. Clone the `boxcli` GitHub repository 
   or download the files from [`examples`][examples] directory.

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git
   ```

2. Set the number of days you want the script to scan for user events. If you   don't specify this value or leave the default, the script will prompt you to enter it.

   ```bash
    $daysInactive = "10"
   ```

3. (Optional) To change the report output file name, define the
   `ReportOutputFile` parameter.

   ```bash
    $ReportOutputFile = $ReportName + ".csv"
   ```

4. (Optional) To change event types, define the list for `eventType` parameter.

   ```bash
    $eventType = "LOGIN,UPLOAD,COPY,MOVE"
   ```

## Run the script

Change the directory to the folder containing the script. 
   In this example, it is the `Inactive Users Report` folder.
   
   ```bash
    rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/Inactive Users Report$ pwsh
    PowerShell 7.2.4
    Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

    https://aka.ms/powershell
    Type 'help' to get help.

    PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/Inactive Users Report>

   ```

Run the script.
   
   ```bash
    ./Inactive_Users_Report.ps1
   ```
   
When the script run is completed, you will see the following 
output or a similar one.

   ```bash
    Transfered employee content Managed User 1
    with User ID: 19927131476 to Employee Archive Folder
    Deleted user 19927131476
    Deleted employee Managed User 1
   ```

## Logging

Logs are stored in the `logs` folder located in the main folder. 
You have access to these log files:

* `Inactive_Users_Report_all.txt` that contains all log entries
* `Inactive_Users_Report_errors.txt` that contains only errors.
