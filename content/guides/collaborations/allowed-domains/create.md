# Allow a domain for collaboration

An enterprise that normally restricts creating collaborations can
add domains, such as `example.com`, to a list for which collaborations may be
created within the enterprise.

<Samples id='post_collaboration_whitelist_entries' />

The
[endpoint](endpoint://post_collaboration_whitelist_entries)
will require the `domain` to allow the collaborations between, and a
`direction`, which may be set to:

* `inbound`: Whether external users may be collaborated in on content in your enterprise.
* `outbound`: Whether your enterprise managed users may be collaborated in on content owned within an external enterprise.
* `both`: Both of the above.

Supply both parameter to set up the new allowed domain.
