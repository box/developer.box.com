# Allowed collaboration domains

Within the content and sharing settings for an enterprise, an admin can specify
[collaboration restrictions][collab-restrictions] for the enterprise. These
settings include the ability to limit collaborations to only a series of
allowed domains.

The allowed domain APIs are available to allow applications with
appropriate permissions to add, fetch, and delete these allowed domains
programmatically for the enterprise.
