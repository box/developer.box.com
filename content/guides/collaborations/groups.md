# Sharing With Groups

To share a file or folder with a group of users, create a collaboration using
the group ID, the ID of the file or folder, and the role or permissions level
the group should have when accessing the file or folder.

<Samples id='post_collaborations' />

<Message>
  The collaboration roles are `editor`, `viewer`, `previewer`, `uploader`,
  `previewer uploader`, `viewer uploader`, `co-owner`, or `owner`. For a full
  description of each role, please refer to our [support documentation].

## Nested objects

When creating a collaboration there are two nested objects within the request
body: `accessible_by` and `item`.

The `accessible_by` object specifies who the item should be shared with and
includes a group `id` and the `type`. The `type` field should always be set to
`group`.

The `item` object specifies what is being shared. It includes a `type` field
which should be set as `file` or `folder`, and an `id` for that file or folder.
