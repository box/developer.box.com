# Collaborations

Collaborations define access permissions for users and groups to files and
folders, similar to access control lists. A collaboration object grants a user
or group access to a file or folder with permissions defined by a specific
role.

The collaboration roles are `editor`, `viewer`, `previewer`, `uploader`,
`previewer uploader`, `viewer uploader`, `co-owner`, or `owner`. For a full
description of each role, please refer to our [support documentation].
