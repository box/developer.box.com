# Share File With User

To share a file with a user, create a collaboration using the user ID or email
address, the ID of the file, and the role or permissions level the user should
have when accessing the file. The collaboration roles are `editor`, `viewer`,
`previewer`, `uploader`, `previewer uploader`, `viewer uploader`, `co-owner`,
or `owner`. For a full description of each role, please refer to our
[support documentation].

## Nested objects

When creating a collaboration there are two nested objects within the request
body: `accessible_by` and `item`.

The `accessible_by` object specifies who the item should be shared with and
includes a group `id` and the `type`. The `type` field should always be set to
`user`.

The `item` object specifies what is being shared. It includes a `type` field
which should be set as `file` and an `id` for that file.
