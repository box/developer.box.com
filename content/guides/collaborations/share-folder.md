# Share Folder With User

To share a folder with a user, create a collaboration using the user ID or
email address, the ID of the folder, and the role or permissions level the
user should have when accessing the folder. The collaboration roles are
`editor`, `viewer`, `previewer`, `uploader`, `previewer uploader`,
`viewer uploader`, `co-owner`, or `owner`. For a full description of each
role, please refer to our [support documentation].

## Nested objects

When creating a collaboration there are two nested objects within the request
body: `accessible_by` and `item`.

The `accessible_by` object specifies who the item should be shared with and
includes a group `id` and the `type`. The `type` field should always be set to
`user`.

The `item` object specifies what is being shared. It includes a `type` field
which should be set as `folder` and an `id` for that folder.
