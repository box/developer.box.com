# Remove Item from Collection

To remove an item from a collection, call the `PUT` endpoint for that specific
type of item and pass along a list of collection IDs that does not include the
ID of the collection that needs to be removed.

<Message warning>
  The only collection that is available via the API is the "Favorites"
  collection and therefore to remove an item from this collection can be
  achieved by passing the API an empty array of collections.
