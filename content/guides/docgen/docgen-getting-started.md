# Get started with Box Doc Gen

To start generating documents with Box Doc Gen API you will need a custom application and a developer token to
authenticate your calls. You also need a Doc Gen template that will serve as an input source for your document.

## Enable Box Doc Gen

To use Box Doc Gen, make sure it is enabled by an
admin in the Admin Console.
If you are a Box Admin, you will find the necessary information in
[Enterprise Settings: Content & Sharing Tab][settings] documentation.

## Create and upload a Box Doc Gen template

To use Box Doc Gen API to generate documents, a Box Doc Gen template must already exist in Box. You have the following options to create a template:

* Install the [Box Doc Gen Template Creator add-in for Microsoft Word][template-addin].
* Create a Box Doc Gen template [using a JSON file][json-template] or manually create [template tags][template-tags].

## Create a custom application

First you need to create a custom application
you will use to make calls. To create
an application, follow the guide
on [creating custom apps][createapps].

## Generate a developer token

You need a developer token
to authenticate your app when sending requests.

To generate a token:

1. Go to **Developer Console** > **My Platform Apps**.
2. Click the **Options menu** button (â€¦) on the right.
3. Select **Generate Developer Token**. The token will be automatically generated and saved to clipboard.

You can also open your app, go to
**Configuration** > **Developer Token**
and generate the token.

<Message type="notice">
A developer token is only valid for one hour.
</Message>

For additional details, see [developer token][token].
After you generate the token, you can use it in cURL
or other clients, such as [Postman][postman], to make
calls.
