# Create File Preview

Once a file has been uploaded to the app token application, it may be previewed
using two different methods:

* Direct embed: A simple HTML `<iframe>` component with a custom embed link.
* Customized previewer: A fully customized preview widget using Box UI Elements.

## Direct Embed (`iframe`)

The direct embed link is a light-weight API method that provides limited
options to customize the preview experience in your application. Due to the
light-weight nature of the method, the API doesn't give you options to respond
to client-side actions such as scrolling in the case of documents, play/pause
interactivity for videos, rotating an image, etc.

There are two steps towards creating a direct `<iframe>` embed for Box View:

1. Generate an embed URL for the file
2. Add the embed URL to an `<iframe>`

### Generate an embed URL for the file

To create a public file preview URL for a file that was uploaded to the app
token application, you may either use a direct SDK method or make the request
directly to the APIs.

<Message type='notice'>
  When generating the embed URL directly from the APIs, use the
  [Get File Information endpoint](e://get_files_id) and request
  `expiring_embed_link` via the `fields` parameter.
</Message>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title='cURL'>

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/FILE_ID?fields=expiring_embed_link \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [APP_TOKEN]"
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title='.NET'>

```dotnet
String fileId = "12345678";
Uri embedUri = await client.FilesManager.GetPreviewLinkAsync(id: fileId);
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title='Java'>

```java
String fileID = "12345678";
BoxFile file = new BoxFile(api, fileID);
URL embedLink = file.getPreviewLink();
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title='Python'>

```python
file_id = '12345678'
embed_url = client.file(file_id).get_embed_url()
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title='Node'>

```js
const fileId = '12345678';
client.files.getEmbedLink(fileId).then(embedURL => {
  // ...
});
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Within the response object will be a public embed URL like the following:

```shell
https://app.box.com/preview/expiring_embed/gvoct6FE!YT_X1LauQ8ulDTad96hTl9xLCRYJ
5iU6O61KxiduxFIgX9HSWMcCWf7zju1XkEsf6-Ul2qtKXeaFeKPT4SysQJQdxrc144KgTIBuoI3bWMf4

Ctqqx6XlN6QrqbhfJc0UeJF9qwMv3-O8q5fWn0qr8OTY4lkeYidtTs3Ux...
```

<Message type='warning'>
  For security reasons, the generated embed link will expire after 1 minute and
  should be immediately embedded in the app once generated.
</Message>

### Add the embed URL to an `<iframe>`

Within the HTML of your application, create an `iframe` elements with the `src`
attribute set to the embed URL generated previously.

```html
<iframe src="https://app.box.com/preview/expiring_embed/gvoct6FE!ixgtCKQAziW
  9tHPm-jueq4cmS4GnL9RTJRcVEsK_3W8xcxtVo_v6gKpoXY45odgG1QrcjBVYZMrriUyGvcoSM

```

## Customized Previewer (UI Elements)

To leverage advanced preview customization and event handling capabilities, the
[Box UI Preview Element](guide://embed/ui-elements/preview/) is available.

To set up the Preview Element, start by installing the required components for
the Content Preview Element.

<CTA to='guide://embed/ui-elements/installation'>
  Install Box Elements and Preview
</CTA>

When adding the JavaScript code to display a new previewer, the basic code will
look something like the following:

```js
var preview = new Box.Preview();
preview.show("FILE_ID", "ACCESS_TOKEN", {
  container: ".preview-container",
  showDownload: true
});
```

To set up the Preview Element with a file stored within your App Token
application, replace the placeholders in the code sample with the following:

* `FILE_ID`: The ID of the file uploaded to the app token application, which may
be obtained from the object returned when uploading the file.
* `ACCESS_TOKEN`: The primary access token set up when configuring the
application or a downscoped version of the token.

<Message type='warning'>
  Due to the elevated privileges of the primary access token it's highly
  recommended that you use a downscoped version of the token in the Javascript
  code. See
  [best practices for downscoping](guide://embed/box-view/best-practices#use-downscoped-tokens).
