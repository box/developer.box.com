# Content Open With

The Box Content Open With UI Element allows developers to embed a dropdown to
open content stored in box with a partner application, or locally on the
desktop.

The Element fetches information about enabled integrations using the
Box API, and calls out to partner services. Users can then take action in these
services, and the edited content will be automatically saved back to Box.

The integrations included in the Open With Element are Adobe Sign, Google Suite,
and Box Edit. Additional information on the Google Suite integration can be
found on the [Box Community site][community].

Currently, the element only supports [App Users](g://authentication/user-types)
for authentication.

## Installation

[Learn how to install](g://embed/ui-elements/installation) Box UI elements
either through NPM or the Box CDN.

<Message>
  # Browser support

UI elements have [limited support](g://embed/ui-elements/browser) for
older browsers. Make sure to add the right polyfills for your targeted browsers.

</Message>

## Box Edit

Box Edit requires additional setup in order to be integrated into a custom
application. Box Edit uses the desktop application [Box Tools][tools] in order
to open content locally.

- Requests must use a secure connection (from an `https` domain)
- The application's domain must be whitelisted by Box Tools. Instructions can be
  found [here][custom-domains]. The ideal workflow is to bundle these steps
  within an installer that also installs Box Tools.
- Safari requires a browser extension to connect to box tools. More details can
  be found [here][safari].

## G Suite

A valid G Suite account is required in order to use the Box for G Suite
integration. To connect a user's G Suite and Box account, the
`external_app_user_id` of the app user must be updated to be the email address
associated with the user's G Suite account.

The `external_app_user_id` of an app user can be updated via the
[`PUT /users/:id`](e://put-users-id) endpoint.

## Setup

The Open With UI Element is intended to be used after whitelisting your
application and enabling integrations for app users using Box API endpoints.

### Activate application

The 'Open With' UI Element is available to any developer building with the Box
Platform. To activate it for your instance, add the "Enable integrations" scope
to your application in the developer console.

<ImageFrame border>

![Enable Integrations](./images/enable-integrations.png)

</ImageFrame>

Once your application has been activated for API calls it will need to be
reauthorized in your enterprise. The steps for performing these actions are
available [here](g://applications/custom-apps/app-approval).

## List available integrations

The first step to assigning an app integration to a user is to get the list of
integrations that are available. This `GET` request can be made with the following
`cURL` request.

```curl
curl -X GET https://api.box.com/2.0/app_integrations \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]'
```

```json
{
  "next_marker": null,
  "entries": [
    { "type": "app_integration", "id": "10897" },
    { "type": "app_integration", "id": "1338" },
    { "type": "app_integration", "id": "13418" },
    { "type": "app_integration", "id": "3282" }
  ],
  "limit": 100
}
```

The app integration IDs are used to assign an integration to a given user.

## Get a specific integration

To obtain additional information about a specific integration, based on ID, the
following GET request may be made.

```curl
curl -X GET \
  https://api.box.com/2.0/app_integrations/[APP_INTEGRATION_ID] \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]'
```

```json
{
  "type": "app_integration",
  "id": "3282",
  "app": {
    "type": "app",
    "id": "81713"
  },
  "name": "Sign with Adobe Sign",
  "description": "Send your document for signature to Adobe Sign",
  "executable_item_types": ["FILE"],
  "restricted_extensions": ["pdf", "doc", "docx", "xls", "xlsx", "ppt", "pptx"],
  "scoped_to": "root"
}
```

## Add integration to user

To add an app integration to a valid app user, three pieces of information are
required:

- A valid [Service Account](g://authentication/user-types) Access Token.
- The ID of the app user to be assigned the integration
- The ID of the app integration to assign to the user

<Message warning>
  While the two previous requests to get app integration information can be done
  with any valid token including a valid developer token, adding and removing
  app integrations requires a valid service account's access token. Using a
  developer token will produce a `404 Not Found` error.
</Message>

The following `POST` request can be made to assign an app integration to an app
user:

```curl
curl -X POST https://api.box.com/2.0/app_integration_assignments \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN]' \
  -d '{
    "assignee": {
      "type": "user",
      "id": "[APP_USER_ID]"
    },
    "app_integration": {
      "type": "app_integration",
      "id": "[APP_INTEGRATION_ID]"
    }
  }'
```

```json
{
  "type": "app_integration_assignment",
  "id": "72048301",
  "assignee": {
    "type": "user",
    "id": "6084519920"
  },
  "app_integration": {
    "type": "app_integration",
    "id": "3282"
  }
}
```

The ID in the JSON response can be used to manage app integrations after
assignment, and should be stored by the application.

## Remove integration from user

To remove an app integration from an app user, the following request may be made
with a valid service access token and the app integration assignment ID from the
previous step.

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

```curl
curl -X DELETE https://api.box.com/2.0/app_integration_assignments/[APP_INTEGRATION_ASSIGNMENT_ID] \
 -H 'Authorization: Bearer [SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN]'

  # Access Token

These demos may not fully function until you provide a valid access token. For
testing purposes, you can use your temporary developer token. This will need
to be updated under the JS tab in the demo.

## Authentication

The UI Elements are designed in an authentication agnostic way so whether
you are using UI Elements for users who have Box accounts (Managed Users) or
non-Box accounts (App Users), UI Elements should work out of the box. The
reason for this is that UI Elements only expect a "token" to be passed in for
authentication, and Box provides two different ways to generate tokens - OAuth
and JWT.

<CTA to="g://authentication/select">
  Learn about selecting an authentication method
</CTA>

## Scopes

To run integrations with downscoped tokens, you must include the
`item_execute_integration` scope as well as the scope required by the specific
integration you would like to use.

- **Google**: `item_readwrite` on the parent folder
- **Adobe**: `root_readwrite`
- **Box Edit**: `item_readwrite` on the parent folder.
- **Box Edit Single File Collaboration**: `item_readwrite` on the file.

More information on scopes can be found [here][scopes].

## API

```js
const { ContentOpenWith } = Box;
const contentOpenWith = new ContentOpenWith();

/**
 * Shows the content open with element.
 *
 * @param {string} fileId - The root file id
 * @param {string} accessToken - Box API access token
 * @param {Object} [options] - Options
 * @return {void}
 */
contentOpenWith..show(fileId, accessToken, options);

/**
 * Hides the content open with element, removes all event listeners,
 * and clears out the
 * HTML.

 */
openWith.hide();

/**

contentOpenWith.addListener(eventName, listener);

/**

 */
contentOpenWith.removeListener(eventName, listener);

/**

contentOpenWith.removeAllListeners();
