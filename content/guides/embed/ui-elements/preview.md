# Content Preview

The Box Content Preview UI Element allows developers to easily embed high
quality and interactive previews of Box files in their desktop or mobile web
application. The library fetches information about the file and its converted
representations through the Box API, chooses the appropriate viewer for the file
type, dynamically loads the necessary static assets and file representations,
and finally renders the file. This UI Element also allows previews of multiple
files to be loaded in the same container and exposes arrows to navigate between
those files.

This UI Element powers Preview in the main Box web application as well as the
'expiring embed' Box API endpoint.

## Installation

[Learn how to install](g://embed/ui-elements/installation) Box UI elements
either through NPM or the Box CDN.

<Message>
  # Browser support

UI elements have [limited support](g://embed/ui-elements/browser) for
older browsers. Make sure to add the right polyfills for your targeted browsers.

</Message>

## Authentication

The UI Elements are designed in an authentication agnostic way so whether
you are using UI Elements for users who have Box accounts (Managed Users) or
non-Box accounts (App Users), UI Elements should just work out of the box. The
reason for this is that UI Elements only expect a "token" to be passed in for
authentication, and Box provides two different ways to generate tokens - OAuth
and JWT.

## Supported File Types

Box Content Preview supports 120+ file types, including most document and image
formats, HD video, 3D models, 360-degree images, and 360-degree videos. You can
find the full list of supported file types [here][filetypes].

<Message warning>
  Please note that where supported file types contain references to other
  objects, for example `DWG` files, those references are not supported in the
  Box preview. A notice will be displayed to all end users viewing a DWG file
  that contains unsupported references letting them know to take alternate steps
  to complete their workflow.
</Message>

## Demo

Use the navigation arrows to preview different file types.

## Token Generator Function

The Preview library optionally takes a token generator function instead of a
string token. Using a token generator function allows you to dynamically
determine what tokens Preview should use. For example, you can pass in different
access tokens for each file or make sure your token is refreshed and valid
before showing a preview. The token generator function should return a promise
that resolves in either a single string token that applies to all of the files
being previewed or a map of typed file IDs to access token for those files.

```js
// Example token generator function that resolves to a single access token
var singleTokenGenerator = function() {
  return someApi.getToken().then(function(data) {
    return data.token;
  });
};

// Example token generator function that resolves to a map of tokens
var mapTokenGenerator = function() {
  return Promise.resolve({
    file_1234: "some_token_abcd",
    file_2345: "some_token_bcde"
  });
};
```

## Events

The preview object exposes `addListener` and `removeListener` for binding to
events. Event listeners should be bound before `show()` is called, otherwise
events can be missed.

```js
const listener = (value) => {
  // Do something with value
};

// Attach listener before calling show otherwise events can be missed
var preview = new Box.Preview();
preview.addListener(EVENTNAME, listener);

// Show a preview
preview.show(...);

// Remove listener when needed
preview.removeListener(EVENTNAME, listener);
```

`EVENTNAME` can be one of the following:

- `viewer` event will be fired when we have the viewer instance first available.
  This will be the same object that is also a property included in the `load`
  event. Preview fires this event before `load` so that clients can attach their
  listeners before the `load` event is fired.
- `load` event will be fired on every preview load when `show()` is called or if
  inter-preview navigation occurs. The event data will contain:

```js
error: 'message', // Error message if any error occurred while loading
viewer: {...},    // Instance of the current viewer object if no error occurred
metrics: {...},   // Performance metrics
file: {...}       // Box file object with properties defined in file.js
```

- `navigate` event will be fired when navigation happens. The event includes the
  file ID of the file being navigated to, and this event will fire before
  `load`.
- `notification` event will be fired when either the preview wrapper or one of
  the viewers wants to notify something like a warning or non-fatal error. The
  event data will contain:

```js
message: 'message', // Message to show
type: 'warning'    // 'warning', 'notice', or 'error'
```

- `viewerevent` Each viewer will fire its own sets of events. For example, the
  Image viewer will fire `rotate` or `resize`, etc. while other viewers may fire
  another set of events. The preview wrapper will also re-emit events at the
  preview level, with event data containing:

```js
event: EVENTNAME,         // Event name
data: DATA,               // Event data object
viewerName: VIEWERNAME,   // Name of the viewer. See VIEWERNAME above
fileId: fileId            // The file ID
```

### Example event usage

```js
var preview = new Box.Preview();
preview.addListener("viewer", viewer => {
  viewer.addListener("rotate", () => {
    // Do something when a viewer rotates a preview
  });
});

preview.addListener("load", data => {
  const viewer = data.viewer;
  viewer.addListener("rotate", () => {
    // Do something when a viewer rotates a preview
  });
});

preview.addListener("viewerevent", data => {
  if (data.viewerName === "Image") {
    if (data.event === "rotate") {
      // Do something when an image preview is rotated
    }
  } else if (data.viewerName === "Image360") {
    if (data.event === "rotate") {
      // Do something different when a 360-degree image is rotated
    }
  } else {
  }
});

preview.addListener("rotate", data => {
  if (data.viewerName === "Image") {
    // Do something when an image preview is rotated
  } else if (data.viewerName === "Image360") {
    // Do something different when a 360-degree image is rotated
  } else {
  }
});
```

## Scopes

If your application requires the end user to only be able to access a subset of
the Content Explorer functionality, you can use [Downscoping][downscope] to
appropriately downscope the Access Token to a resulting token that has the
desired set of permissions, and can thus, be securely passed to the end user
client initializing the Content Explorer.

Below are a set of UI Element-specific scopes to go alongside Downscoping. These
allow developers to enable/disable UI controls on the Content Explorer by
configuring the appropriate scopes on the downscoped token. To learn
more, see [Special Scopes for Box UI Elements][scopes].

### Base Scope

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Scope Name     | Permissions granted                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `base_preview` | Allows the user to preview the file, nothing else |

### Feature Scopes

| Scope Name             | Permissions granted                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| `annotation_edit`      | Allow user to edit annotations (delete). Note: For highlight annotations to work, the text layer on the document needs to be enabled for the user. Text layer is disabled for all users that don't have download permissions on the file. To enable highlight annotations for a user, please ensure they have download permissions on the file. |
| `annotation_view_all`  | Allows user to view all users' annotations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `annotation_view_self` | Allows user to view their own annotations only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
