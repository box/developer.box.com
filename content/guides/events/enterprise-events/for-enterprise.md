# Get Enterprise Events

To get a enterprise's events, make
a call to the [`GET /events`](e://get_events) API with the `stream_type` set to
`admin_logs` or `admin_logs_streaming`.

<Message>
  This API requires the user to be an enterprise admin or co-admin with the
  permission to **Run new reports and access existing reports**.

## Stream Types

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Stream Type |                                                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `admin_logs`       | Enables querying historical events up to one year                                                 |
| `admin_logs_streaming`   | Enables subscribing to live events in near real time                      |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

## Live Monitoring

To monitor recent events that have been generated within Box across the
enterprise, set the `stream_type` to `admin_logs_streaming`. This is also known
as the Enterprise Event Stream API.

The emphasis for this feed is on low latency rather than chronological
accuracy, which means that Box may return events more than once and out of
chronological order. Events are returned via the API in near real time after
they are processed by Box. A small delay/buffer ensures that new events are not
written after your cursor position. Only two weeks of events are available via
this `stream_type`.

## Historical Querying

To query historical events across the enterprise up to one year old, set the
`stream_type` to `admin_logs`. This is also known as the Enterprise Event
History API.

The emphasis for this feed is on completeness over latency, which means that
Box will deliver admin events in chronological order and without duplicates,
but with higher latency than the user or `admin_logs_streaming` feed. Consuming
events in near real time may lead to missed events as events can arrive later
than your filtering window.

## Anonymous Users

In some cases, the event feed might list a user with an ID of `2`. This is Box's
internal identifier for anonymous users.

An anonymous user is a user that is not logged in. This can happen any time a
user interacts with content and they aren't asked to log in first. An example
would be when a user downloads a file through an open shared link.

## Limitations

The enterprise event feed does not support long polling.

Box does not store events indefinitely. Two weeks of enterprise events are
available when `stream_type` is set to `admin_logs_streaming`. One year of
enterprise events are available when `stream_type` is set to `admin_logs`.
Seven years of enterprise events are available via the Box Admin Consoleâ€™s
[exported reports][reports].

The emphasis of the `admin_logs_streaming` feed is to return the complete
results quickly, which means that Box may return events more than once and out
of order. Duplicate events can be identified by their event IDs.

## Filter by Event Type

The enterprise event feed supports filtering by event type.

## Event Types

The following events can be triggered for an enterprise. This list is not 
exhaustive, so it is possible events appear that are not listed.
