# Enterprise Events

Enterprise events provide an event feed for all users and content in an
enterprise Box instance. Depending upon the `stream_type` your application can
either subscribe to live events or query historical events. Access to these
stream types is limited to users with admin permissions
to **Run new reports and access existing reports**.
