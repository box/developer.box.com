# Get Enterprise Events

To get a enterprise's events, authenticate a user with admin permission and make
a call to the [`GET /events`](e://get_events) API with the `stream_type` set to
`admin_logs`.

<Samples id="get_events" />

<Message>
  This API requires the user to be an enterprise admin or co-admin with the
  permission to **Run new reports and access existing reports**.
</Message>

## Filter by Event Type

The enterprise event feed support filtering by event type.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events?event_type=LOGIN,FAILED_LOGIN \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

A full list of event types can be found below.

## Limitations

The admin event feed does not support long polling. To long poll for events, use
the user event feed.

Box does not store events indefinitely.

User events are stored for between two weeks and two months, after which the
user events are removed. Enterprise events are accessible for one year via the
API and seven years via exported reports in the Box Admin Console.

The emphasis for this feed is on completeness over latency, which means that Box
may deliver admin events with higher latency than the user feed. Unlike the user
events stream, the admin events stream supports filtering for specific events
but does not support long polling.

## Event Types

The following events can be triggered for an enterprise.

## Anonymous Users

In some cases, the event feed might list a user with an ID of `2`. This is Box's
internal identifier for anonymous users.

An anonymous user is a user that is not logged in. This can happen any time a
user interacts with content and they aren't asked to log in first. An example
would be when a user downloads a file through an open shared link.
