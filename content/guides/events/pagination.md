# Stream Position Pagination

Paginating the event stream works through the use of the `stream_position`
parameter.

First, send a request to the [`GET /events`](e://get_events) API without a
`stream_position` query parameter.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The API will return all available events beginning with the oldest. The response
will also include a `next_stream_position` value that can be used to make the
next API call for the next place in the stream.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events?stream_position=388720462721 \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

The `stream_position` can also be set to `now` to return the most recent stream
position.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/events?stream_position=now \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

In this case, the API returns an empty list and a `next_stream_position` that
can be used for the next call.
