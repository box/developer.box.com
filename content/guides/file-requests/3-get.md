# Get information for a File Request

To get details about an existing [file request](g://file-requests/template),
all you need is its unique ID.

<Message notice>

The ID of a file request can be determined by visiting the Box web
app and inspecting the URL. Please
[check our guide](g://file-requests/template) on setting up a file
