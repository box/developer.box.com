# Delete a File Request

To delete a file request, all you need is its unique ID.

<Samples id='delete_file_requests_id' />

<Message notice>

The ID of a file request can be determined by visiting the Box web
app and inspecting the URL. Please 
[check our guide](g://file-requests/template) on setting up a file
request template to learn how to determine a file request ID.
