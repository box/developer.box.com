## Name restrictions

There are some restrictions to the folder name. Names containing non-printable
ASCII characters, forward and backward slashes (`/`, `\`), as well as names
with trailing spaces are prohibited.

Additionally, the names `.` and `..` are reserved names and therefore
also prohibited.
