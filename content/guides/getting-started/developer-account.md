# Create a developer account

Create your developer account to start developing applications with Box.
Once you create an account, you will get a Developer Enterprise, where
you can:

- access to the admin-facing tools,
- create new users for testing purposes,
- create and upload content needed for testing. 

The Developer Enterprise is very similar to the live customer environments.
Keep in mind that it is a base-level enterprise, so it does not include
add-on Box products, such as Box Shield or Governance. If you need any
additional features for the enterprise, contact your Box Partner.

There is no cost associated to the API calls for the Developer Enterprise.
There is also no limit to the number of test users you will add during the
development process, but there is a hard limit of 10GB of total storage
and max upload size is 250MB.

Go to the Box [developer portal][developer-portal]. Sign up using
your company email address. The best practice is to use an email that is
not connected to an existing Box account. 

Once you receive a confirmation email and set your password, you can start
developing your first [application][app].

If you don't receive the confirmation email, you can try resending the
confirmation email yourself. If that doesn't work, contact your Box
Partner for further assistance.
