Create your developer account to start developing applications with Box.
Once you create an account, you will get a Developer Enterprise, where
you can:
- access to the admin-facing tools,
- create new users for testing purposes,
- create and upload content needed for testing. 

The Developer Enterprise is very similar to the live customer environments.

<Message type='notice'>
There is no cost associated to the API calls for the Developer Enterprise.
There is also no limit to the number of users you will add during development
process.
