# Publish your app

When you finish the platform app configuration and testing, you can publish
it in the [Box Integrations][integrations]. It allows customers to find
your app and add it to their Box accounts.

<Message type='warning'>

Only apps that use the OAuth 2.0 authentication have a built-in publication option. In case you use a different auth type for your integration, you can still create and publish an OAuth 2.0 platform app that will serve as a marketing listing in the **Integrations** and redirect customers to your website.

To publish your platform app:

1. Open the **Dev Console**.
2. Select the platform app you want to publish.
3. Go to the **Publishing** tab.
4. Read through the submission checklist and check the confirmation checkbox if your app meets all the requirements.
5. The next step is the marketing section of the app, where you need to add the following app information:

    - **General Info** - choose correct categories and platforms for your app to make it easier to find in the Integrations,
    - **Description** - make sure it contains all information about your app that the customers may find useful,
        - **Short Description** appears next to your app logo, together with your app name;
        - **Long Description** is what the users see after they select your app to view its details. You can add clickable links to the long description.
    - **Screenshots** and **Icon** - provide the screenshots to allow the users see how the app looks like and how it integrates with Box. The icon is needed to represent your app in the list of Integrations.
    - **Support Resources** - A list of links and supplementary information that will help the users to work with your app.

6. Before submitting your app, preview it to see if you included all the necessary information.
7. Submit your app for approval. Box will review your app and publish it under Integrations.
