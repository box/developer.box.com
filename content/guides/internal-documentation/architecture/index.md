# Developer Documentation Architecture

The following is an overview of the build system for the new
[developer documentation] site. 

## High Level Architecture

The build architecture for developer documentation is split into three
parts:

- Validating and resolving sources used to build the developer documentation,
- Fetching sources and compiling the site when any of the sources change,
- Publishing the site to our hosting provider.
