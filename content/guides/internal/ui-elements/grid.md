# Grid

A basic grid can be established by wrapping elements in a `Grid` element. Grids
of 2, 3, and 4 columns are supported.

```html
<Grid columns='4'>
  ...
</Grid>
```

<Message warning>
  Depending on the content of the grid you might get different results. It's
  recommended to use grids in combination with nested custom elements.
