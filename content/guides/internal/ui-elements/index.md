# Documentation UI

The following is an overview of some custom React components that are supported
in these docs.

## Technical Implementation

Explain how this works

## Common Issues

1. React components can be self closing or have an open and close tag. We try to
   fix this for you on build time.
2. Nested React components work, but it is advised not to indent the body, as
   indented content is treated as a blockquote in Markdown.
3. React component names are not case sensitive. Feel free to use `message` or
   `Message`.
