# Metadata templates

A [metadata template][template] describes a set of key/value
pairs that can be assigned to a file or folder.

For example, an `invoiceData` template might hold data about an invoice, having
a field for the invoice ID as well as the customer ID.

A file or folder can have multiple distinct template [instances][instance]
associated with it, such as a `marketingCollateral` instance and a
`retentionPolicy` instance.

## Metadata scopes

Metadata templates are grouped into two distinct groups, or **scopes**.
