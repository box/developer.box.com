# Metadata instances

A [metadata instance][instance] describes the relation between
a [metadata template][template] and a file or folder. It includes the values
that are assigned for every field of the template.

For example, a user might have assigned an `invoiceData` metadata template to a
file and provided 2 values, one for the invoice ID and one for the customer ID.

[template]: g://metadata/templates
[instance]: g://metadata/instances
