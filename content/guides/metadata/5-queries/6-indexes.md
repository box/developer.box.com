# Indexes

Due to scale considerations a metadata query might return a `HTTP 403` error
when the metadata template has been applied to more than 1,000 files or folders.
A search index can be created to resolve this error for a specific search query.

If the number of metadata instances exceeds 1,000 then a metadata query request
which does not include a suitable **index** in the `​use_index​` parameter will
result in an error. The error will inform the caller to specify a suitable index
as the argument to the `​use_index​` parameter. 

<Message notice>
  We expect this limit to be raised but not to be eliminated in the future.

## Request an index

At this time you will need to contact Box to create an search index. Please
reach out to your customer success manager or the Box [support team][support].

To create an index, we will need to be informed of the intended query will be
run including the exact values for the `from​`, `​query​`, and `​order_by​`
parameters of the request. 

An index will then be created and you will be provided with the the name of this
index which then needs be used in the `​use_index​` parameter of a query
request. 

If you prefer to specify a name for the index please provide that name upon
requesting the index.

### Example index request

The following is an example request for an index. It is essential to include all
the information for the `​from`, `query`, and `order_by​` parameters.
