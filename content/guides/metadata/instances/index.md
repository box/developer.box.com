# Metadata instances

A Metadata Instance describes the relation between
a [MetaData Template][template] and a file or folder. It includes the values set
for this file or folder for the metadata template

For example, a user might have assigned an `invoiceData` metadata template to a
file and provided 2 values, one for the invoice ID and one for the purchase
order ID.

[template]: g://metadata/templates
