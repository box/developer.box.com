# Android

The [Box Android SDK][android-sdk] provides native access to the Box API from
within your Android project.

<Message type='warning'>
As of May 31, 2023 Android SDK is no
longer supported.
You can still use your
existing Android SDK applications with no impact,
but you won't receive new features,
updates, or bug fixes.

If you would like to continue getting
the latest and greatest Android features, 
we recommend using Java SDK to build apps on Android.
Refer to [this][android-docs] documentation for more details.
