  # Install the iOS SDK using Carthage

  1. From a terminal window, install Carthage: `brew install carthage`.
    Visit the [Carthage documentation][carthage-docs]
    for other installation methods.
  2. At the root of your iOS application folder, where the `{APPNAME}.xcodeproj`
     is located, create a new file named `Cartfile`, without an extension.
  3. Open the `Cartfile` and add the **Box iOS SDK** dependency with
     `git "https://github.com/box/box-ios-sdk.git" ~> 3.0`, then save and close
     the file.
  4. From the terminal, in the folder where the `Cartfile` is present, update
     all dependencies: `carthage update --platform iOS`. A `Cartfile.resolved`
     file and a `Carthage` directory will be created in the directory. 
  5. Within a Finder or File Explorer window load the **Carthage** -> **Build**
     -> **iOS** directory. This should have a framework file named
     `BoxSDK.framework`. Keep this window open as we'll use it to add the
     framework to our project in the next step.
  6. In your Xcode project, click on the name of your application at the top of
     the project navigator on the left. In the content that displays, click on
     the name of your project under the **TARGETS** option. Scroll down to
     **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content**. 
  7. Drag `BoxSDK.framework` from our Finder window over to the frameworks
     section.

  # Install the iOS SDK using CocoaPods

  1. From a terminal window, install CocoaPods: `sudo gem install cocoapods`.
  2. At the root of your iOS application folder, where the `APPNAME.xcodeproj`
     is located, run `pod init` to create a new `Podfile` with smart defaults.
  3. Load `Podfile`, add the **Box iOS SDK** dependency under
     `# Pods for {APPNAME}` with `pod 'BoxSDK', '~> 3.0'`, then save and close.
  4. From the terminal, in the folder where the `Podfile` is present, download
     all dependencies: `pod install`.
  5. Open `.xcworkspace` in Xcode: `open {APPNAME}.xcworkspace` and build the
     project.
