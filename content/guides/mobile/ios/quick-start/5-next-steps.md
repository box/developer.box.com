# Next steps

You've reached the end of this Quick Start guide. By now you should have taken
the following steps.

1. [Created a new iOS app](g://mobile/ios/quick-start/create-ios-app/) in Xcode.
2. [Installed the iOS SDK](g://mobile/ios/quick-start/install-ios-sdk/)
   into your project.
3. [Configured a Box App](g://mobile/ios/quick-start/configure-box-app/)
   so that the iOS SDK can access the Box API.
4. [Made your first API call](g://mobile/ios/quick-start/make-api-call/)
   to the Box API with the iOS SDK.

## Next things to do

To take the next step with your application, the following resources are
recommended.

* [Token Downscoping](g://authentication/access-tokens/downscope/): In this 
quick start guide you used a developer token to make your first call. To
implement a scalable solution you should have a server-side solution to
generate downscoped tokens to replace that implementation.
* [Official JWT sample application][sample-jwt]: Bundled with the iOS SDK, this
sample application will get you started quickly with a properly structured Box
JWT application, which doesn't require user login.
* [Official OAuth 2 sample application][sample-oauth]: Bundled with the iOS
SDK, this sample application will get you started quickly with a properly
structured Box OAuth 2 application, which requires user login.
