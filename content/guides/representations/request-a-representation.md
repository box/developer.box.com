# Request Desired Representation

To select a specific representation call the [`GET /files/:id`][get_files_id]
endpoint with a [`x-rep-hints`][x-rep-hints]-header defining the
required representation format.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "x-rep-hints: [pdf]" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple dimensions

Some formats will require the `dimensions` to be passed in to select a
specific size. This can be achieved by appending the `dimensions` to the
header.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## Multiple representations

Multiple representations can be fetched by chaining the different
types in the `x-rep-hints`-header.

```curl
curl https://api.box.com/2.0/files/123?fields=representations \
  -H "x-rep-hints: [pdf][jpg?dimensions=94x94]" \
  -H "authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

## API Response

This API call will result in one or more representations with a `url_template`
value that includes a `{+asset_path}` value.

<Message type='notice'>
  The `url_template` in this response is an **opaque** URL. This URL format
  might change over time and no assumptions should be made about its format
  except for the presence of the `{+asset_path}` variable.
