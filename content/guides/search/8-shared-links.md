# Finding recent shared links

By default, the search API only returns items that are either owned by the user
or items that the user has been explicitly collaborated on. These search results
do not include any items that a user might have accessed recently through a
shared link.

To enable shared links in the API, the `include_recent_shared_links` query
parameter can be set to `true`.
