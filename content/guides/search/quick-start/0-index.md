# Search content using metadata

The Box Metadata Query API enables programmatic search of Box content based
strictly on applied custom metadata values. 

The structure of a metadata query is similar to that of a SQL query and allows
for Boolean operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, as well as comparison or range
operators, such as equal to, greater-than, and less-than. 

Some benefits of the Metadata Query API include: 

* no indexing delay; query immediately after metadata creations, updates, and
  deletions
* ability to specify a sort order by one or more fields
* no limitation on the number of characters that are queryable
* queries return item properties and metadata instances
