# Locate Information about a Metadata Template

<Message warning>
  If you created your metadata template using the API and have the successful 
  response on hand, you can skip this step.  
</Message>

If you created your metadata template via the Admin Console, you will need 
obtain an [Access Token][at] for an Admin or Co-Admin with permission to
**Create and edit metadata templates for your company**. As mentioned in
step 1, the easiest way to obtain a token meeting these requirements is to log
in as an Admin or Co-Admin, pull up the application in the
[Developer Console][dc], and click **Generate Developer Token** under the
**Configuration** tab. 

Use this token to make an API call to the
[list all metadata templates for enterprise endpoint][metadata-list], as shown
below. You should be able to find information about your template in the
response. Specifically, note the `scope` and `templateKey`.
