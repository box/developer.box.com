# Terms of Service

The Box API allows administrators to configure Terms of Services for working on
Box, and for users to accept & re-accept Terms of Services for custom
applications.

## Terminology

### Terms of Services

A Terms of Service is a enterprise-level record that represent the conditions
within which all users are allowed to work with an enterprise's data in Box.

There are currently two types of Terms of Service for any enterprise that can be
enabled and disabled independently. The **Managed Terms of Service** can be
enabled for the enterprise's own users, where the **External Terms of Service*
can be enabled for users from other enterprises that collaborated in on the
primary enterprise's data.

## Terms of Service User Statuses

A Terms of Service User Status represents the status of the Terms of Service
acceptance for a specific user. There is exactly one Terms of Service User
Status for any given combination of Terms of Service and a user.

There are multiple Terms of Service User Statuses for any Terms of Service,
specifically one for each each user.

There could be multiple Terms of Service User Statuses for a given user. The
user could accept or reject multiple External Terms of Services for different
enterprises they have been collaborated into, in addition to accepting or
rejecting their own enterpriseâ€™s Managed Terms of Service.

## APIs

for your company** permissions can view, create, and edit Terms of Services for
