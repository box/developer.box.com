# Shared Link Permissions

The shared link resource has three permissions that can be updated using the
`permissions` field: `can_preview`, `can_download`, `can_edit`.

<Message type='warning'>
  The `can_edit` option can only be `true` for files. Also, if the admin has
  restricted shared links from having edit access in the admin console, you
  will not be able to set `can_edit` to `true`.
