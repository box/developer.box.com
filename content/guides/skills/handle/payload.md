# Parsing a Skills Payload

When a new file is uploaded to a folder monitored by a Skills app, the
invocation URL that was specified during application setup and authentication
will receive an event payload from Box.

The event payload will contain all information needed to read in the content of
the uploaded file to send to a processing system, such as a machine learning
system, and to write metadata back to the file once the processing system has
completed.

## Payload Components

The Skills event payload can be broken down into the following top level objects:

| Object | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| `type` | The type of event, which will always be `skill_invocation`. |
| `skill` | Details of the Custom Skills app that sent the event. This
information should be used to verify the source of the request. |
| `token` | Two
[downscoped tokens](guide://authentication/access-tokens/downscope) for
accessing the uploaded file. The `read` token should be used to download the
file for the processing system, and the `write` token should be used to store
metadata back to the uploaded file once the processing is complete. |
| `status` | The status of the event. |
| `id` | The unique event ID |
| `created_at` | When the event was created. |
| `trigger` | The type of action that triggered the event. |
| `enterprise` | Information about the Enterprise where the event was triggered
from. This information should be used to verify the source of the request. |
| `source` | Information on the file that was uploaded that triggered the event.
Use this information to make API requests to download the file and store
metadata back to the file. |
| `event` | The Skills event information. |
| `parameters` | Additional details that may be sent with the event. |

At a bare minimum, the following three pieces of information are what you will
require to download the file and update metadata back to the file:

* Read token: Located within the `token` object, the read token will allow you
to call the [download file endpoint](endpoint://get_files_id) to download the
file content to send to the processing system.
* Write token: Located within the `token` object, the write token will allow
you to call the
[create metadata on file endpoint](endpoint://post_files_id_metadata_id_id)
once the file processing has completed.
* File ID: Located within the `source` object, the file ID will be needed by
the above two endpoints to determine which file should be downloaded or have
metadata applied to it.
