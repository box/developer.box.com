# Find app user for SSO identity

When a user logs into a Box custom application with their SSO provider, the
first step that should be taken is to see if that user already exists from a
previous login attempt where a Box user record was already created. 

If a Box user is found you should
[create a user access token](guide://authentication/jwt/user-access-tokens/),
or make [as user calls](guide://authentication/jwt/as-user/), to access Box
APIs as that user.

If a Box user is not found you should create a new user with an association to
the SSO user record. 

To search for existing users the [List Enterprise Users](ref://get-users/)
endpoint may be used. Depending on whether you're using the
`external_app_user_id` or `login` method your query will look slightly
different.

## Find user by `external_app_user_id`

To search for enterprise users by the stored `external_app_user_id` value you
will need one piece of information from the SSO provider:

* UID (required): The unique identifier from the SSO user record.

Once available, make a request to the list enterprise users endpoint, supplying
the `external_app_user_id` definition in the parameters.

    // Check enterprise users for matching external_app_user_id against SSO UID
    client.enterprise.getUsers({ "external_app_user_id": ssoUID })
    .then((users) => {
      if (users.total_count > 0) {
        // User found, fetch user ID
        const userId = users.entries[0].id;
      } else {

    user_info = response.json()

      # User found, fetch user ID
      user = user_info['entries'][0]
      user_id = user['id']

## Find user by email address

To search for enterprise users by their `login` email you
will need one piece of information from the SSO provider:

* Email (required): The unique email from the SSO user record.

Once available, make a request to the list enterprise users endpoint, supplying
the email address as the `filter_term`, which is made available to search by
email or name.

        // User found, fetch user ID
        const userId = users.entries[0].id;

      # User not found - create new user record
    else:
      # User found, fetch user ID
      user = users['entries'][0]
      user_id = user['id']
