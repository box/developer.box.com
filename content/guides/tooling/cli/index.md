# CLI

The Box Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for making requests to
Box APIs from your terminal window or command prompt.

## Prerequisites

[Get started using the Box CLI with OAuth 2.0][qs].

## Sample Scripts

Using the Box CLI is great by itself, but it becomes even more powerful when
combined with a Powershell script. We've created a [library][scripts]
of script templates for you to get started automating repetitive tasks.

- [User provisioning and initial folder tree creation][script-1]

## Advanced

The GitHub page also has some additional guides that might be of interest to an
advanced CLI user.

- [Setup autocomplete][cli-autocomplete]
- [Configure another app][cli-add-config]
- [Switch accounts][cli-switch]
- [Token cache][cache]
- [Autocomplete][ac]

## Box CLI Using Client Credentials Grant Authentication

If you would rather use our [CCG authentication][ccg] method, check out
