# Using PowerShell Scripts with the Box CLI

By itself, the CLI is already powerful, but using it alongside a PowerShell
script lets you complete repetitive tasks even quicker. We created an example
[scripts][scripts] folder within our CLI GitHub repository to help
jump start your development.

For this step in the quick start, we are going to use the
create users and provisioning automation [script][script-1]
template.

This script uses the Box CLI to build and create a user-owned 
(admin or service account) onboarding folder structure, 
create managed users in bulk, 
and provision such new users by adding them to the newly created 
folder structure as collaborators with viewer or uploader roles.

<Message type=warning>
   Only service accounts and users with administrative privileges are able
   to go through this part of the quick start. You can skip this step if you
   are not a Box administrator or using a service account.

## Use case

The use case presented in this example is to illustrate the automatic 
creation of users:

- using a `.csv` file to load users in bulk
- have a predetermined folder structure associated to each user
- define that folder structure using a JSON file
- or, optionally, create the folder structure by uploading from a local drive

## Prerequisites

### Windows

- Install the latest version of [dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

### MacOS & Linux

- Install [PowerShell][pwsh]

If you encounter issues make sure you installed both 
[dotnet core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) and 
[PowerShell][pwsh]

### Configured Box application

You should have a Box application created.
If you haven't done so yet, see [step 1][Step 1] of this quick start guide.
Alternatively, go to your [developer console][console], and follow the guide 
[Setup with OAuth 2.0][auth].

## Download script

```bash
git clone https://github.com/box/boxcli.git box-cli
cd box-cli/examples/User\ Creation\ \&\ Provisioning/
```

## Modify script configuration

You must adapt this script to run in your own environment.

### Prepare the user list

You can use the following sample files to load users:
`Employees_1.csv`, `Employees_5.csv`, and `Employees_10.csv`. 
Each will load 1, 5 or 10 new users.

Customize these files for a test run. For example, update the 
`Employees_1.csv` with the following data:

```bash
firstName,lastName,email
Isaac,Newton,abc@abc.local
```

In the `Users_Create_Provision.ps1` script file, specify which `.csv` 
file you would like to load. For example, `Employees_1.csv`:

```bash
#Set Employee List CSV Path
$EmployeeList = "./Employees_1.csv"
```

### Create folder structure

You can either create a folder structure from a JSON 
file, or upload it from your local drive.

### Using a JSON file

The `Folder_Structure.json` file represents the folder structure you want to create.
As an example we're going to create a `Market Research` and a `Sales Plays` 
folder, each with a subfolder `Statistics` and `Big Pharma` respectively.

On the script file `Users_Create_Provision.ps1` you also have some options to 
choose from.

The folder creation section in the script has the folder `Onboarding` hard 
coded. This means that whatever folders are present 
in the `Folder_Structure.json` file, 
they will be created under the `Onboarding` folder.

```bash
#First create Onboarding folder owned by current user
$script:OnboardingFolderId = box folders:create 0 "Onboarding" --id-only 
Write-Output "Created a user owned Onboarding folder with id: $($OnboardingFolderId)"
```

Set the location of the `Folder_Structure.json` file.

```bash
#Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly
# upload a local folder
$FolderStructureJSONPath = "./Folder_Structure.json"
#$LocalUploadPath = "./OnboardingLocalUpload"
```

### Uploading from a local drive

The script also shows the example of uploading a folder structure directly 
from the local file system.
If you want to try that, set the path to your local folder:

```bash
#Onboarding Folder Structure: Set either path build off JSON or directly
# upload a local folder
#$FolderStructureJSONPath = "./Folder_Structure.json"
$LocalUploadPath = "./OnboardingLocalUpload"
```

Comment the `New-Folder-Structure` call, and uncomment the next section:

```bash
#Create Folder Structure from JSON
#New-Folder-Structure

#OR directly upload Folder structure to current user's root folder
# from local directory

$script:OnboardingFolderId = box folders:upload $LocalUploadPath --id-only
Write-Output "Uploaded local folder structre to current user's root folder 
with $($script:OnboardingFolderId)"
```

## Run the script

Now all you need to do is run the script.
Change the directory to the folder containing the script. 
In this example, it is the `User Creation & Provisioning` 
folder.

```bash
rvb@lab:~/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning$ pwsh
PowerShell 7.2.4
Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

https://aka.ms/powershell
Type 'help' to get help.

PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning>
```

Run the script:

```bash
PS /home/rvb/box-cli/examples/User Creation & Provisioning> ./Users_Create_Provision.ps1
Starting User Creation & Provisioning script...
