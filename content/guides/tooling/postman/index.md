# Postman Collection

[Postman][postman] is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP requests in an
easy-to-use interface without configuring a full development environment. The
**Box Postman Collection** is a set of preconfigured requests that make it easy to
get started with the Box API.

The simplest way to get started with Postman is with our Postman Quick Start guide.

## Latest Collection

Clicking the following button will install our latest Postman
collection. It is a complete Postman collection that covers every API endpoint
and is auto-generated from our [OpenAPI specification][openapi]. It is expected
to get many more updates including some to make authentication a lot easier.

<Message warning>
  The Postman collection requires the [Postman desktop app][postman] to be
  installed. The Box Postman collection does not support the now deprecated
  Postman Chrome application.
