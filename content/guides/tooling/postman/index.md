# Postman Collection

[Postman][postman] is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP requests in an
easy-to-use interface without configuring a full development environment. The
Box Postman Collection is a set of preconfigured requests that make it easy to
get started with the Box API from Postman.

## Prerequisites

To use the Box Postman Collection, first [install the Postman app][downloads].
Next, install one of the next collections.

## Box Postman Collection

Clicking the following button will install our [legacy Postman][legacy]
collection. It is an incomplete Postman collection and is not expected to get
any more updates, but has some nice features that are (for now) still missing
from the new collection.

## New Beta Collection

Clicking the following button will install our new, Beta Postman
collection. It is an complete Postman collection that covers every API endpoint
and is auto-generated from our [OpenAPI specification][openapi]. It is expected
to get many more updates including some to make authentication a lot easier.
