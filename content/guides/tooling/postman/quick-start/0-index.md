# Quick Start

[Postman](https://getpostman.com) is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP
requests in an easy-to-use
interface without configuring a full development environment. The Box Postman
Collection is a set of preconfigured requests that make it easy to get started
with the Box API from Postman.
