# Methods and Operations

## Toolkit Details

Class Name: `box.Toolkit`

## Instance Variables

### `mostRecentError`

String to indicate the most recent error that occurred when calling instance
methods.

The presence of this string does not mean the operation failed. It is possible
the error was recoverable; however, the lack of a value in this string does
indicate the operation was successful.

### `Enum CollaborationType`

Enum to indicate the [type of collaboration][collab-type].

Possible values: `EDITOR`, `VIEWER`, `PREVIEWER`, `UPLOADER`, `COOWNER`,
`OWNER`, `PREVIEWERUPLOADER`, or `VIEWERUPLOADER`

## Static Methods

### `deleteServiceUserAssociation`

Method to clear association between Service Account and Box for Salesforce
integration. This can be used to change the service account if an incorrect one
is being used.

Parameters:

* None

Returns:

* `true` if the user's account existed and was deleted.
* `false` if the user's account was not deleted for any reason (including
because it didn't exist).

### `deleteUserAssociation`

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `userId` | id | The Id of the user whose credentials are to be cleared. |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Returns:

* `true` if the user's account existed and was deleted.
* `false` if the user's account was not deleted for any reason (including
because it didn't exist).

## Instance Methods (Constructors / Destructors)

### `box.Toolkit()`

Parameters:

* None

### `commitChanges`

Treat this method as a destructor for the `box.Toolkit()` method.

<Message type='warning'>
  This method is critical. It must be called after all folder / collaboration
  operations are complete. Every time. No Exceptions.
</Message>

Since Salesforce doesn't allow callouts after database updates / inserts /
deletes have occurred, the Toolkit class maintains some collections of objects
to be inserted once all callout operations are complete. If this method is not
called, those objects won't be in the database, and the tables that keep track
of user / record / folder associations will be out of sync and will need some
advanced debugging to fix.

Parameters:

* None

Returns:

* `Void`

## Generic Methods

The Box for Salesforce Developer Toolkit provides a global method that accepts
an [HttpRequest][sf-httprequest] object as a parameter and returns an
[HttpResponse][sf-httpresponse] object. This method will utilize the
authentication details of the Service Account to make callouts to Box's APIs,
allowing you to focus on the business logic of your integration.

### `sendRequest`

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `request` | [HttpRequest][sf-httprequest] | An HttpRequest object with a set endpoint and method. |

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

Returns:

* An [HttpResponse][sf-httpresponse] object with the response details from
calling Box's APIs.
* `Toolkit.BoxApiException` if there is any missing information from the
HttpRequest input.
* `null` if there was an issue getting the authentication details for the
Service Account. In this case, check `mostRecentError`.

## File Operations

### `createFileFromAttachment`

<Message type='notice'>
  Available in version 3.46 and above.

  Salesforce has a String length limit of 6 million characters. Due to string
  bloat in the base64 encoding/decoding process, this results in an effective
  file size limit of 4.3 megabytes.
