# Install Box CLI

The Box Command Line Interface (CLI) is a tool for making requests to
Box APIs from your terminal window or command prompt.

Installers are available for Windows and macOS, and the raw source-code is
available for building the CLI in other environments.

## Windows & macOS Installers

To install the latest CLI on your machine, download the latest
`.exe` for Windows or `.pkg` for macOS for the latest release.

## Source Code

The source code for the CLI is also available via [the GitHub page][cli].

## Quick Start

To get started, first [set up a Box Custom App][jwt-guide] using Server-side
Authentication with JWT and download the JSON configuration file from the
Configuration page of your app in the [developer Console][devconsole]. Then, set
up the CLI by pointing it to your configuration file:.

```cli
box configure:environments:add [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]
```

Next, make your first API call by listing the content of the JWT app's Service
Account.

```cli
box folders:get 0
```

<Message>
  The root folder for any account always has ID `0`. A JWT application does not
  automatically authenticate as an actual managed user, instead it uses a
  Service Account. See [User Types](g://authentication/user-types) for more details.
</Message>

## Setup & Commands

For a complete list of steps to set up your CLI environment and start working
with the CLI post-install are available on our [Box CLI GitHub page][cli].

The GitHub page also has some additional guides that might be of interest to an
advanced CLI user.
