  In mid-August, we will be deprecating the Box Next Gen SDKs in its current form. Donâ€™t worry, your existing code will continue to work without changes.

You can use Box .NET SDK to call Box APIs in a .NET
project.

The SDK is available for both .NET Framework 4.5 and .NET Core 1.0 or
above. The installation of the SDK depends on the framework used.
