## Swift Package Manager

[Swift Package Manager][spm] is a tool for managing the distribution of Swift code. It is integrated with the Swift build system to automate the process of downloading, compiling, and linking dependencies.

To add a dependency to your Xcode project:

1. Select **File** > **Add Package Dependency** in your Xcode project.
2. Click the **plus** icon > **Add Package Collection**.
2. Enter the following repository URL: `https://github.com/box/box-swift-sdk-gen.git` and click **Load**.

Alternatively you can add a dependency to the dependencies value of your `Package.swift`.

For detailed instructions, please see the official documentation for [Swift Package Manager][spm] and [XCode documentation][xcode].

## Carthage

Carthage is a decentralized dependency manager which builds your dependencies and provides you with binary frameworks.

To add a dependency to `BoxSdkGen`:

1. add the following line to your `Cartfile` :

```bash
git "https://github.com/box/box-swift-sdk-gen.git"
```

2. Run:

```bash
carthage bootstrap --use-xcframeworks
```

3. Drag the built `xcframework` from **Carthage/Build** into your project.

For more detailed instructions, please see the [official documentation for Carthage][carthage].
