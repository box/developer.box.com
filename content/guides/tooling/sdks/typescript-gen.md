# Deprecated Box Next Gen TypeScript SDK

<Message type='warning'>
  As of September 17, 2025 Box Next Generation SDKs are no longer supported as separate artifacts.

  Donâ€™t worry, your existing code will continue to work without changes. You can still use your applications based on Box Next Generation SDKs with no impact, but you won't receive new features, updates, or bug fixes.

  All future development, including new features and updates for the Next Generation SDKs, will be delivered through Box core SDKs starting with version `v10`. Currently, `v10` available as a separate branch.

  For more details, see our [SDK versioning strategy document][versioning].
