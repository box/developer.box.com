# Trash

Before items are deleted they might end up in a user's trash. The trash can be
managed by a user through any of the Box apps, and by an application via the
API.

## Two-stage Deletion Process

Box uses a two-stage process to remove or **trash** [files], [folders], and
[web links] before permanently deleting them.

By default, items can be restored after they are **trashed** within a 30 day
time frame before they are **purged**. The purge window can be modified by
an enterprise administrator.

More details can be found in the Box community article on [Managing Trash]
