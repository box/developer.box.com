# Trash

Before items are deleted they might end up in a user's trash. The trash can be
managed in the UI or via the API.

## Two-stage Deletion Process

Box uses a two-stage process to remove or "trash" [files], [folders], or
[web links] before permanently deleting them. By default, these items can be
restored once trashed within a 30 day period before they are purged. The purge
window can be modified by administrators of Business or Enterprise accounts.

More details can be found in the Box community article on [Managing Trash]
