# Commit Upload Session

The final step in a chunked upload is to commit the session.

To commit a file upload session, call the
[`POST /files/upload_sessions/:id/commit`][e_commit] with a list of uploaded
parts to commit.

<Samples id='post_files_upload_sessions_id_commit' />

<Message>
  Additionally, any file `attributes` can be passed along with the `parts` to
  further add information to the file. See the [`POST /files/content`][e_file]
  API for more details.
</Message>

## Response

When successful, the API returns a HTTP `201 Created` status code with a
[`File`][r_file] object.

In some cases, creating the parts might not be ready yet and the API will return
a `202 Accepted` status code instead. In this case the application should check
the `retry-after` header and retry committing after the number of seconds
specified.
