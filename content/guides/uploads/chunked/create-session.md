# Create Upload Session

To create an upload session, call the
[`POST /files/upload_sessions`][createsession] API with the desired `file_name`
and `folder_id` to put the file in, as well as the `file_size` of the file to be
uploaded.

<Samples sample='post_files_upload_sessions' />

To create a session for a new version of an existing file, call the
[`POST /files/:id/upload_sessions`][createsessionversion] API instead. In this
case, the `file_name` and `folder_id` are only required when renaming or moving
the file in the process.

<Samples sample='post_files_id_upload_sessions' />

## Pre-flight Check

Creating an upload session also performs a [preflight check][check], making it
unnecessary to do so separately when working with chunked uploads.

## Response

When a session is created successfully the response includes an [Upload
Session][uploadsession] that includes a session ID, the number of parts, the
part sizes, as well as links to the relevant next API endpoints to use.
