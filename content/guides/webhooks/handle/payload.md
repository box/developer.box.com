# Webhook Payload

When an event triggers a webhook for a file or a folder, it make a HTTP call to the
`address` specified when the webhook was created. The payload of this call
contains some request headers, and a JSON body.

## Payload headers

The payload sent by a webhook has the following Box-specific headers.

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Header                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `BOX-DELIVERY-ID`         | A unique ID assigned by Box that identifies the delivered webhook payload. When Box retries a webhook this ID will change, while the ID in the body of the payload remains the same. |
| `BOX-DELIVERY-TIMESTAMP`  | An RFC-3339 timestamp that identifies the time that the payload was sent at.                                                                                                         |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-PRIMARY`   | A [signature][verify_sigs] created using the primary signature key configured for this webhook.                                                                                                     |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-SECONDARY` | A [signature][verify_sigs] created using the secondary signature key configured for this webhook.                                                                                                   |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-VERSION`   | Value is always `1`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `BOX-SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM` | Value is always `HmacSHA256` .                                                                                                                                                       |

For example:

```shell
BOX-DELIVERY-ID:          673a081b-bb4b-4d45-b4f1-4131a29c1d07
BOX-DELIVERY-TIMESTAMP:   2016-07-11T10:10:33-07:00
BOX-SIGNATURE-PRIMARY:    isCeDp7mLR41/MjcSEFLag9bWmpJkgmN80Je4VIESdo=
BOX-SIGNATURE-SECONDARY:  1UbiiKS7/2o5vNIlyMh7e5QGCHq8lflWFgEF+YWBugI=
BOX-SIGNATURE-VERSION:    1
BOX-SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM:  HmacSHA256
USER-AGENT:               Box-WH-Client/0.1
```

<Message type='notice'>
  We recommend [setting up][setup_sigs] and [verifying signatures][verify_sigs]
  of the webhook payloads.
</Message>

<Message warning>
  HTTP header names are case insensitive and your client should ideally convert
  all header names to a standardized lowercase or uppercase format before trying
  to determine the value of a header.
</Message>

## Payload body

The body of a webhook payload is a JSON object that describes the file or folder
(target) that triggered the webhook, as well as the event that has been
triggered.

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                  |

| `type`       | Value is always `webhook_event`.                                                                                                                             |
| `id`         | A unique ID assigned by Box that identifies the event. When Box retries a webhook this ID will not change, while the ID in the header changes between calls. |
| `created_at` | The time/date that the event was triggered at.                                                                                                               |
| `trigger`    | The name of the event that triggered the event, for example `FILE.UPLOADED`.                                                                                 |

| `created_by` | The user that triggered this event.                                                                                                                          |
| `source`     | The item that triggered this event, for example the file that was uploaded to the target folder                                                              |
