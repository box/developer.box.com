# V1 Webhooks

Webhooks created using the [Developer Console][console] monitor changes to all
files and folders within a user's account. When creating one of these webhooks
it is not possible specify a specific object to bind the webhook to. To create
a webhook for a specific file or folder, you will need to leverage
[v2 webhooks][v2].

<Message type='warning'>
  Webhooks created through this process will not show when listing all
  webhooks for a user via API call. All V1 webhooks are visible in the
  **Webhooks** tab in the [Developer Console][console].
