resource_variant_descriptions:
  // base: |-
    Describes the base-resource variant
  base: |-
    This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
    using the API.

    The fields that are part of the **base** variant represent
    the default fields that are always returned when using the `fields`
    query parameter, additional to the fields specified in the
    parameter.

  // mini: |-
    Describes the mini-resource variant
  mini: |-
    This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
    using the API.

    The fields that are part of the **mini** variant are generally
    returned when the resource is nested within the response for
    another resource.

  // standard: |-
    Describes the standard-resource variant
  standard: |-
    This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
    using the API.

    The fields that are part of the **standard** variant are generally
    returned when the resource is requested via its own API endpoints.
    For example, when retrieving a file by ID, it will return
    these fields unless the `fields` parameter has been specified.

  // full: |-
    Describes the full-resource variant
  full: |-
    This resource has a few variations that can be encountered when
    using the API.

    The fields that are part of the **full** variant can be returned
    by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter. For example,
    by defining the `fields` request parameter as
    `id,type` when requesting a file by ID, only those fields will
    be returned in the API response.

  Welcome to our updated developer documentation, which
  is still very much a work in progress. For now it only
  contains our reference documentation while we work on
  moving more of our documentation over to this site.
