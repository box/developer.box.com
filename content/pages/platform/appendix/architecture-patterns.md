# Architecture Patterns

We recommend creating a visual representation for your application before
writing any code. The architecture patterns shown below are generic and do not
represent an exhaustive list of possibilities.

## Administrative tasks

</ImageFrame>

Components:

- A server or local machine running a PowerShell script
- An identity provider with a user provisioning/deprovisioning service
- A [Service Account][sa] owned folder containing a personal folder for each
  user
- A PowerShell script based on a time that monitors the [event stream][events]
  and creates/collaborates each user on their personal folder

## Vault Portal

</ImageFrame>

Components:

- A custom portal allowing users to collaborate in a non-Box branded environment
- A load balancer distributing users to a web server with the deployed portal
- Users can login using credentials maintained in an identity provider, which
  are then mapped to [App User][au] information from Box within a data server.
- Other site data is stored on the data server

## Box Skill

In this example, external users upload their resumes via a [file request][fr].

A [Box Skill][skill] is set to monitor any upload/move/copy actions in a
specific folder. When an event occurs, the file is sent to a cloud provider to
be processed by any machine learning service. Once it is processed, information
is [saved back to the file as metadata][metadata]. This metadata can then be
used in another process or for future reference.
