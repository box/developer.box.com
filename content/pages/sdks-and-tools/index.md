**Maintained:** Fully maintained projects are actively developed by Box. They
receive the latest security updates and new features. For support with these
projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support forum][forum].

**API Parity**: Projects with full API parity are actively updated with all
platform functionality as this becomes available on the Box Platform. Projects
with partial API parity lack some functionality while we work on bringing
these projects to full parity.

**Maintained:** Projects with limited maintenance are updated by Box in
collaboration with the community. They receive irregular security updates. If
you are a Box customer on a premium support plan, please contact customer
services for any urgent feature requests for these tools. For other support
queries with these projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support
forum][forum].

**API Parity:**  Projects with limited API parity can lack some functionality
as new features are not automatically rolled out to these projects as they
become available for the Box Platform. If you are a Box customer on a premium
support plan, please contact customer services for any urgent feature requests
for these tools.
