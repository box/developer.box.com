# SDKs & Tools

The following SDKs and tools are developed and supported by Box.

## SDKs

Here you will find a list of SDKs
you can use to build your application.
Separately, we have listed the next generation
Python and Typescript SDKs, which are the
newest addition.
They are still a beta feature, but we encourage
you to give them a try and explore all the
features they bring along.

<Message type='notice'>
The tables below list SDKs along with additional information
telling you if the project is maintained and has API
parity.

**Maintained:** Fully maintained projects are actively developed by Box. They
receive the latest security updates and new features. For support with these
projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support forum][forum].

**API Parity**: Projects with full API parity are actively updated with all
platform functionality as this becomes available on the Box Platform. Projects
with partial API parity lack some functionality while we work on bringing
these projects to full parity.
</Message>

### Next generation SDKs

The latest generation Box Python SDK and Box Typescript
SDK are designed to elevate the developer
experience and streamline your integration
with the Box Content Cloud.

<Message type='notice'>
New Typescript and Python SDKs are in a Public Beta phase.
</Message>

Here's what you can expect from the new SDKs:

* **Full API Support**: New Box SDKs empower developers
 with complete coverage of the Box API ecosystem.
 You can access all the latest features and
functionalities offered by Box and build feature-rich applications.
* **Rapid API Updates**: The new auto-generation development
approach allows for adding Box APIs to
SDKs at a much faster pace (in a matter of days). 
This means you can leverage the most up-to-date
features in your applications without delay.
* **Embedded Documentation**:  All objects and parameters
are documented directly in the source code of the SDK
so all the necessary information is stored in one place.
* **Enhanced Convenience Methods**: The newly introduced
convenience methods cover various aspects such as
authentication, chunk uploads, exponential back-offs, 
automatic retries, type checkers which
help to ensure that you’re using variables correctly, 
and much more.

As of May 31, 2023 Android SDK is no
longer supported. You can still
use your existing Android SDK applications
with no impact, but you won't receive new features,
updates, or bug fixes.

If you would like to continue getting the
latest and greatest Android features, we
recommend using Java SDK to build apps on Android.
Refer to [this][android-docs] documentation for more details.

## Box CLI

allows both technical and non-technical users to
leverage Box API to perform routine or bulk actions.

## Postman Collection

[Postman][postman] is a tool that lets you build and test HTTP requests in an
easy-to-use interface without configuring a full development environment. The
**Box Postman Collection** is a set of preconfigured requests that make it
possible to get started with the Box API without having to manually configure
the requests.

The simplest way to get started with Postman is with our Postman Quick Start guide.

## Salesforce Developer Toolkit

The Box for Salesforce Developer Toolkit allows customers to programmatically
customize the behavior of the Box for Salesforce integration. The Toolkit
consists of several global APEX methods that can be used to trigger and extend
the default behavior. The global methods can update the internal Salesforce
record to Box folder mapping and handle permission management.

<Message type='notice'>
  This functionality is part of the latest Box for
  [Salesforce package][sf-package].
</Message>

<Message type='warning'>
  # What the Toolkit does NOT provide

  The Toolkit is not a full-featured APEX wrapper for the BOX Content API. If
  this is what you are looking for, have a look at the
  [Box SDK for Salesforce][sf-sdk].
