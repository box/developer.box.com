# Quick start

Get a sense of how the [Box Sign API][api-basics] is structured and how to
create your first signature request.

The Sign API does not follow the traditional CRUD model. You can create,
resend, and cancel signature requests. You can also list all signature requests
and get details of a specific signature request.

Sign Templates API is read-only. You can list all templates and get details of
a specific template.

Once you get a sense of the API, you can create
[your first signature request][quick-start].
