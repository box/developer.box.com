# Redirect URLs

Often after signing a document your company might want to redirect the user to
a specific web page like a thank you or an onboarding page. There are two
features to support these requirements.

When the signer completes the signature process, they can be redirected to a
web page. The same can happen when the signer declines the signature request.

We can customize these pages by passing the `redirect_url` and
`decline_redirect_url` parameters.

For example:

<Tabs>
<Tab title='cURL'>

```curl
curl --location 'https://api.box.com/2.0/sign_requests' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Authorization: Bearer ej...3t' \
    --data-raw '{
      "is_document_preparation_needed": true,
      "redirect_url": "https://forum.box.com/",
      "declined_redirect_url": "https://developer.box.com/",
      "parent_folder": {
        "id": "234102987614",
        "type": "folder"
      },
      "source_files": [
        {
          "id": "1358047520478",
          "type": "file"
        }
      ],
      "signers": [
        {
          "email": "signer@example.com",
          "role": "signer"
        }
      ]
    }'
```

</Tab>
<Tab title='Python Gen SDK'>

```python
def sign_doc_single_more_options(
    ...

    redirect_url: str = None,
    declined_redirect_url: str = None,
) -> SignRequest:
    ...

    # sign document
    sign_request = client.sign_requests.create_sign_request(
        ...

        redirect_url=redirect_url,
        declined_redirect_url=declined_redirect_url,
    )

    return sign_request

def main():
    ...

    # Sign with redirects
    sign_with_redirects = sign_doc_single_more_options(
        client,
        SIMPLE_PDF,
        SIGN_DOCS_FOLDER,
        SIGNER_A,
        prep_needed=False,
        redirect_url="https://forum.box.com/",
        declined_redirect_url="https://developer.box.com/",
    )
    check_sign_request(sign_with_redirects)
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

If you sign you’ll be redirected to our forum page. If you decline you’ll be
redirected to our developer page.
