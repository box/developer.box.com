# Sign webhooks

Sign webhooks allow you to receive notifications about events that happen with 
Box Sign signature requests. You can use them to trigger actions in your own 
application, or to notify your users about events that happen in Box Sign.

This is particularly important since the signature requests are asynchronous, 
and the signers can interact with them at any time, possibly outside of your 
application.

## Sign related events

There are Box Sign-related events that can trigger the webhooks. Like most of Box events the listeners are set at the folder or document level.

The most common use case is to listen to the events at the folder where the 
signature requests are created. This way you can listen to all the signature 
requests created in that folder.

Some examples of events that can be listened to are:

- `SIGN_REQUEST.COMPLETED`, when a signature request is completed.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.DECLINED`, when a signature request is declined.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.EXPIRED`, when a signature request expires.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.SIGNER_EMAIL_BOUNCED`, when a signer's email is bounced.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.SIGNER_SIGNED`, when the signature request is signed.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.SIGNATURE_REQUESTED`, when the signature is requested from the signer.
- `SIGN_REQUEST.ERROR_FINALIZING`, when the signature request could not be processed.
