## Scaffold a page

The simplest way to create a new page is with the `yarn new:page` command.

```sh
yarn new:page support/online
```

This would create a new markdown file based on a template in
`content/pages/support/online.md`, creating any folders if needed.

## Lint a new page

Once created, lint the page using `yarn lint`. Any spelling mistakes or broken
links should pop up automatically.
