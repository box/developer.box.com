# Box MCP server

Model Context Protocol ([MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. MCP servers make building advanced integrations simpler and less time consuming.

Box MCP server allows third party AI agents from platforms like Anthropic's Claude, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Mistral Le Chat to access Box content seamlessly. It extends the agentâ€™s capabilities by allowing it to perform actions related to content stored in Box.

- self-hosted Box MCP server which you can clone and host on your local machine, as this version in an open source Box Developer community project.
