# Delete Collaboration Whitelist

Deleting a collaboration whitelist entry will remove the ability for
collaborations to be created between your enterprise and the domain listed in
that whitelist.

To delete a collaboration whitelist, supply the domain whitelist entry ID to
the delete request, which is returned when
[creating a new whitelist entry](guide://collaboration-whitelists/create-whitelist)
or
[listing whitelists in the enterprise](guide://collaboration-whitelists/list-whitelists);
