# Enterprise Events

Enterprise events provide an event feed for all users and content in an
enterprise Box instance. Depending upon the `stream_type` your application can
either subscribe to live events or query historical events. Access to these
stream types is limited to users with admin permissions to Run new reports and
access existing reports.
