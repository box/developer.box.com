# Publish your application

When you finish the app configuration and testing, you can publish
it in the [Box Integrations][integrations]. It allows customers to find
your application and add it to their Box accounts.

<Message type='warning'>

Only applications that use the OAuth 2.0 authentication have a
built-in publication option. You can use other user authentication
types, but such app can only serve as a marketing listing in the
Integrations and redirect customers to your website.

</Message>

To publish your app:

1. Open the **Dev Console**.
2. Select the application you want to publish.
3. Go to the **Integrations** tab and submit your app.

This action gives you access to the marketing section of the
application, where you need to add the following app information:

- **General App Info** - choose correct categories and platforms for your application to make it easier to find in the Integrations,
- **App Description** - make sure it contains all information about your application that the customers may find useful,
    - **Short Description** appears next to your app logo, together with your app name;
    - **Long Description** is what the users see after they select your app to view its details. You can add clickable links to the long description.

<Message type='notice'>

Specific guidelines for screenshots and logos are provided in the Dev
Console.

</Message>

When you're finished with providing the details about your app,
submit your app for approval. Box will review your application
and publish it in the Integrations.
