# Next steps

You've reached the end of this Quick Start guide. By now you should have taken
the following steps.

1. [Installed Postman](g://tooling/postman/quick-start/install-postman/) on your device.
2. [Configured a Box App](g://tooling/postman/quick-start/configure-box-app/) in order to be able to authenticate a Postman App for accessing Box.
3. [Logged in](g://tooling/postman/quick-start/log-in-to-box/) to the Box App to get the right API credentials.
4. [Loaded Box's Postman collection](g://tooling/postman/quick-start/load-postman-collection/) into Postman, and with it all the credentials needed to make API calls.
5. [Made your first API call](g://tooling/postman/quick-start/make-api-call/) to the Box API with Postman.
