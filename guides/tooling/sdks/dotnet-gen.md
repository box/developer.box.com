# Deprecated Box Next Gen .NET SDK

<Message type='warning'>

As of September 17, 2025 Box Next Generation SDKs are no longer supported as separate artifacts.

Don’t worry, your existing code will continue to work without changes. You can still use your applications based on Box Next Generation SDKs with no impact, but you won't receive new features, updates, or bug fixes.

All future development, including new features and updates, will be delivered through the Box core SDKs. The standalone generated artifact was introduced in the version `v10` of the Box core SDKs, and it is currently available as a separate [branch][sdk-branch].

</Message>

Check the [migration guide][migration] to learn how to switch from the Box Next Generation SDK to the Box core SDK `v10`.

For more details, see our [SDK versioning strategy document][versioning].
