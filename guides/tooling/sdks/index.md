<Message type="notice">

**Maintained:** Fully maintained projects are actively developed by Box. They
receive the latest security updates and new features. For support with these
projects please visit GitHub or [our Platform support forum][forum].

**API Parity**: Projects with full API parity are actively updated with all
platform functionality as this becomes available on the Box Platform. Projects
with partial API parity lack some functionality while we work on bringing
these projects to full parity.
