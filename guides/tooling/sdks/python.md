# Install Python SDK (Deprecated)

You can use Box Python SDK to call Box APIs in a Python project.

<Message type='notice'>

[Python SDK](https://github.com/box/box-python-sdk)
is currently in maintenance mode and will be deprecated soon.
This means only critical security updates and bug fixes will be
implemented.
It is recommended to use the [auto-generated Python SDK][python-gen].
