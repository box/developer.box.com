The Box API supports a variety of users, ranging from real employees logging in
with their Managed User account, to applications using App Users to drive

## (De-)Provision Users

Managing the onboarding and offboarding of employees, customers, and users is a
common requirement in the lifespan of a Box application.

During account provisioning the main tasks that will be needed will be:

* How to create new app and managed user accounts to represent the users.
* How to instantiate the new user account with common or repeatable folder and file architectures.

During account deprovisioning the main tasks that will be needed will be:

* How to transfer files and folders from one account to another for offboarding.
* How to delete user accounts.
