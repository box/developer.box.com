  Variations
  ==========

  This resource has 3 variations that can be encountered when
  using the API.

  * The **mini** variant is used when the resource is nested within the
    response for another resource. For example, the mini variant of a
    `User` is often nested within other resources to represent
    ownership of an item.

  * The **standard** variant represents the  default set of attributes
    that are returned requesting the resource it via its API endpoints.
    For example. when retrieving a `File` by ID, it will return
    these the **standard** fields by default, unless the `fields`
    request parameter has been specified.

  * The **full** variant represents all the attributes that can be
    requested by API endpoints that support the `fields` parameter.
    For example, by defining the `fields` request parameter as
    `id,type` when requesting a `File` by ID, only those fields will
    be returned in the API response.
